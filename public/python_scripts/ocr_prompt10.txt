Hi,
Your job is to mimic an alert and knowledgeable Law Clerk
who will fix some legal text created by OCR software.
I have a file called legal_doc.png
which acts as a legal document
which a California Court judge to wants to read.
The first page inside legal_doc.png
contains a section which lawyers call a "Caption".
A Caption is a very simple table:
Row 1 has 2 columns with info about the author of legal_doc.png and next the Court and Case Number,
Row 2 has 1 column naming the court (usually in a county in California),
Row 3, often with a column separator, has 2 columns describing
1: Plaintiff(s) and Defendant(s),
2: More case info and info specific to this document.

Know that most pages (on the left side)
in legal_doc.png,
have a column of integers starting at 1 and usually ending at 28.
Lawyers use those integers
to identify statements during discussions about legal_doc.png;
Also each paragraph in legal_doc.png usually starts with an integer
which lawyers rely upon to identify paragraphs during discussions.
At the bottom of each page
inside legal_doc.png
is a short one-line document-description which lawyers call the "Footer";
the Footer on each page
identically matches each Footer on other pages.
At the bottom of each page,
below the Footer,
is an integer, the page number, which identifies that page.
I have a file called legal_doc.txt
which I created from legal_doc.png
using tesseract OCR software.
Know that I just gave you some information
which an alert human (a Law Clerk) would use to fix errors created by OCR software.
I want you to act as that Law Clerk.
When I use my vision to compare legal_doc.png to legal_doc.txt
I see that tesseract OCR software makes errors
and discards information
when it creates text from the image(s) in legal_doc.png.
As a Law Clerk,
please study my above description of legal_doc.png,
and combine that information with your knowledge about documents filed with California Courts.
Now we move on to the next phase of this task.
Please, study the information you see in legal_doc.txt,
and combine that information your knowledge of legal_doc.png and California Court documents.
The text in legal_doc.txt contains many OCR errors but it also is extremely rich in clues
useful to you, an alert and knowlegeable Law Clerk.
Here is the final phase of this task.
As Law Clerk, please generate text from legal_doc.txt for me to study.
After I study that text I will copy the best parts into a better text file I will call:
legal_doc_more_accurate.txt;
I want legal_doc_more_accurate.txt
to act as a duplicate of legal_doc.png
but in text format.
Currently, I cannot use legal_doc.txt
as text-formatted duplicate of legal_doc.png
because legal_doc.txt has too many errors.
So that is the essence of your task; I need you, a Law Clerk,
to enhance the OCR output we see in legal_doc.txt;
Typically this task is done by an alert Law Clerk
who uses general knowledge of legal document formats
and good eyesight to fix errors made by OCR software.
Thanks!
