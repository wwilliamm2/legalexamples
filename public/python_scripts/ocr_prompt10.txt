Hi Gemini 2.0,
Your job is to fix some text created by OCR software.
I have a file called legal_doc.png which acts as a legal document which a California Court judge to wants to read.
The first page inside legal_doc.png contains a section which lawyers call a "Caption".
A Caption is a very simple table:
Row 1 has 2 columns with info about the author of legal_doc.png and next the Court and Case Number,
Row 2 is 1 column naming the court (somewhere in California),
Row 3 has 2 columns describing 1: Plaintiff and Defendant, 2: More Case information.
On the left side, each page in legal_doc.png has a column of integers starting at 1 and usually ending at 28.
Lawyers use those integers to identify statements during discussions about legal_doc.png
and also each paragraph in legal_doc.png usually starts with an integer
which lawyers rely upon to identify paragraphs during discussions.
At the bottom of each page inside legal_doc.png is a short one-line document-description which lawyers call the "Footer"
and the Footer on each page identically matches each Footer on other pages.
At the bottom of each page, below the Footer, is an integer, the page number, which identifies that page.
I have a file called legal_doc.txt which I created from legal_doc.png using tesseract OCR software.
So, I just gave you some information which an alert human would use to fix errors created by OCR software.
When I use my vision to compare legal_doc.png to legal_doc.txt
I see that tesseract OCR software makes errors
and discards information when it creates text from the image(s) in legal_doc.png.
Please study my above description of legal_doc.png,
and combine that information with your knowledge about documents filed with California Courts.
Now we move on to the next phase of this task.
Please, study the information you see in legal_doc.txt,
and combine that information your knowledge of legal_doc.png and California Court documents.
Here is the final phase of this task.
Please generate text which I will copy into a better text file I will call:
legal_doc_more_accurate.txt;
I want legal_doc_more_accurate.txt to act as a duplicate of legal_doc.png but in text format.
legal_doc.txt, the file I showed you, has too many errors.
So that is the essence of your task; I need your help to enhance the OCR output we see in legal_doc.txt;
Typically this task is done by an alert human who uses general knowledge of legal document formats
and good eyesight to fix errors made by OCR software.
Thanks!
