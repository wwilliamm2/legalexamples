**Case Number: 18STCV01564**
**Hearing Date: September 18, 2023**
**Dept: 31**

*   **Parties:**
    *   Plaintiff: STEPHEN HARRIS
    *   Defendant: JACK SWANK, ET AL.
*   **Subject:** \[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S EXPERTS’ DEPOSITIONS
*   **Background:**
    *   On October 19, 2018, Plaintiff Stephen Harris filed a Complaint against Defendant Jack Swank ("Decedent"), for damages from an automobile accident.
    *   On October 20, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Creditor’s Claim.
    *   Plaintiff brought a motion to substitute Judith Lorraine Swank (“Swank” or “Defendant”) as the personal representative of Decedent, which was granted on August 29, 2023.
    *   On May 25, 2023, Decedent filed a motion to compel depositions of Plaintiff’s experts.
    *   Plaintiff's only argument in opposition is that the motion was filed on behalf of Decedent at the time, and therefore defense counsel lacks authority to notice or take depositions in this case.
    *   Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s motion is untimely and should not be considered, and that the Court at a recent informal discovery conference (“IDC”) ordered Plaintiff to make Plaintiff’s experts immediately available. Furthermore, Defendant argues that Plaintiff still has not served the Administrator of the Estate with the Complaint as ordered.
*   **Procedural:**
    *   The Court will consider Plaintiff’s opposition, despite it being slightly late.
    *   The Court is guided by Code Civ. Proc. § 377.30, which states that a cause of action survives the death of the person entitled to commence an action or proceeding passes to the decedent’s successor in interest . . . and an action may be commenced by the decedent’s personal representatives or, if none, by the decedent’s successor in interest.
    *   The Court will not consider Defendant’s argument that Plaintiff still has not served the amended complaint on Swank because the purpose of a reply brief is not to raise new issues. Regardless, Plaintiff was ordered to serve Swank with an amended complaint within 20 days of the ruling. (Min. Order, Aug. 29, 2023.) The due date is the day of the hearing on the instant motion, on September 18, 2023. Therefore, the time had yet to expire for Defendant to properly set forth this argument.
*   **Motion to Compel Deposition of Plaintiff’s Experts:**
    *   Defendant argues the depositions of Plaintiff’s experts Steven Dunbar, D.C. and Babak Samimi, M.D. were properly noticed, and that Plaintiff failed to produce these experts.
    *   Defense counsel’s declaration refers to six exhibits in support of the motion, none of which were attached to the declaration.
    *   The Court will not consider any documents outside of and not properly incorporated to the motion.
    *   It is not clear that Defendant tendered the expert witness fee or whether the parties stipulated otherwise.
    *   **Ruling:** The motion compelling Steven Dunbar, D.C.’s and Babak Samimi, M.D.’s deposition is DENIED without prejudice.
*   **Order:** Moving party is ordered to give notice.
