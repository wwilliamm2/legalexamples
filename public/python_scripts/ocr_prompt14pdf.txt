Hi,
The attached document is a scan of an original document.
The original document has an important message for me
but I only have the scanned document.
Please study the text in the attached document and use your semantic knowledge
to fix typos made by OCR scanning software. For example hel1o should be changed to
hello and $1o,42m3.OQ should be $10,4233.00.
Sacramento Coimty should be Sacramento County.
If you encounter a word which fails spell-check but visually resembles a valid
word, please consider that you have just encountered an OCR-typo.
I offer you 4 more examples of OCR typos which I found using my semantic knowledge:
'''Tmstee should be Trustee, Febmary should be February, tme should be true, or time or tame or me.'''
After you correct the typos in that text,
Please extract the corrected text, verbatim, from your context,
and show it to me.
I want to copy and paste that corrected text into my editor to check it for spelling errors.
Please output only information from attached document;
Please withhold any information which describes your
thoughts, motivations, observations, and actions
because your thoughts might obscure information from the original document.

Thanks!
