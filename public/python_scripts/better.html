<p>Լոս Անջելեսի Առաջին ատյանի դատարանի հանրային կայքի պաշտոնական լեզուն անգլերենն է։ Google™ Translate-ն անվճար լեզվական թարգմանչական ծառայություն է, որի միջոցով տեքստ ու կայքեր կարելի է թարգմանել զանազան լեզուներով։ Համակարգչային թարգմանությունը կայքի բնօրինակի սոսկ մոտավոր ներկայացումն է։ Թարգմանությունը չպետք է դիտվի իբրև ճշգրիտ, և երբեմն կարող է ներառել ոչ ճիշտ, կամ վիրավորական արտահայտություններ։</p>

<p>Խնդրում ենք նկատի ունենալ, որ թարգմանության խնդրանք ներկայացնելիս Դուք Լոս Անջելեսի Առաջին ատյանի դատարանի կայքից դուրս կտեղափոխվեք։ Լոս Անջելեսի Առաջին ատյանի դատարանը չի քաջալերում Google™ Translate-ի օգտագործումը։ Մեր կայքը կարելի է դիտել այլ թարգմանչական ծառայություններով ևս։ Ցանկացած անձ, կամ կազմակերպություն, ով հենվում է որևէ թարգմանչական համակարգից ստացված որևէ տեղեկատվության վրա, այդպես է վարվում սեփական ռիսկի հաշվին։ Թարգմանության ավարտին, Դուք հանձն եք առնում ցանկացած անճշտության, սխալի, կամ հայտնաբերված այլ խնդրի ռիսկը։ Լոս Անջելեսի Առաջին ատյանի դատարանը պատասխանատու չէ որևէ այնպիսի վնասի կամ խնդրի համար, որը թերևս կարող է առաջանալ Google™ Translate-ի, կամ թարգմանչական մեկ այլ համակարգի օգտագործման արդյունքում։</p>

<p><b><u><span>Background</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On March
22, 2021, Carolina Gonzalez and Carlos Victor (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed
a complaint against J&amp;B Management, LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through
25, asserting causes of action for premises liability, loss of consortium, and negligent
infliction of emotional distress, all arising out of slip and fall incident on
March 22, 2019.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On July
31, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On January 16,
2025, Defendant this motion to continue trial. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>No opposition
has been filed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>While this
motion was pending, the Court, on January 23, 2025, the Court granted in part Defendant’s
ex parte application to continue trial.Defendant
had requested a continuance of the trial date from February 24 to June 10, 2025;
the Court granted a continuance of 30 days and set trial for March 26, 2025.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>When this case
was filed, the Court set a trial date of September 19, 2022.That trial date was vacated.At a trial setting conference in November
2023, the Court set a trial date of February 24, 2025.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Legal Standard</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (<i>Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams</i> (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (<i>Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens</i> (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm.All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)“The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”(<i>Ibid.</i>) Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(3) The length
of the continuance requested;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (<i>Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court</i> (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord <i>Cole v. Superior
Court</i> (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Discussion</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>As a threshold matter, the motion was not
timely served.When a motion is
personally served, the motion must be served 16 court days before the hearing;
when the motion is electronically served, two additional court days are
added.(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd.
(b) &amp; § 1010.6, subd. (a)(3).)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>For a motion hearing on February 10, 2025,
the last day for personal service was January 16, 2025.The last day for electronic service was January
14, 2025.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Here, the motion was electronically served on
January 16, 2025.That is late.For that reason, the motion is denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Separately and independently, the motion is
also denied on the merits.Defendant appeared
in this action more than 18 months ago and has had more than an adequate amount
of time to conduct and complete discovery (and to bring any discovery motions,
as needed).The Court, by ex parte
application filed while this motion was pending, granted a trial continuance of
30 days.Defendant has not shown good
cause for any further continuance of the trial date so that the parties can
conduct discovery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Conclusion</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><u><span>Legal
Standard</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>A defendant may
move for judgment on the pleadings when the “complaint does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1)(B)(ii).) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“A motion for
judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and
hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters
that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore
not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”  (<i>Cloud v.
Northrop Grumman Corp</i>. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)  “The standard
for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as
that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the
pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears
that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (<i>Bezirdjian
v. O'Reilly</i> (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322; accord <i>Los
Angeles Unified School Dist. v. Torres Construction Corp. </i>(2020) 57
Cal.App.5th 480, 494; <i>Templo v. State </i>(2018) 24 Cal.App.5th
730, 735; <i>Schabarum v. California Legislature</i> (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216; see also 1 Weil &amp; Brown, California Practice Guide:
Civil Procedure Before Trial [2024] ¶ 7:275.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Discussion</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff
asserts causes of action for negligence and premises liability. The basic
elements of a cause of action for negligence and for premises liability are the
same: (1) the existence of a legal duty; (2) breach of that duty; (3)
causation; and (4) resulting damages. (<i>Brown v. USA Taekwondo</i> (2021)
11 Cal.5th 204, 213; <i>Kesner v. Superior Court</i> (2016) 1 Cal.5th
1132, 1158; <i>Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp</i> (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
994, 998.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Defendant now
moves for judgment on the pleadings.  The motion is based on the prior
order of the Court deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters
specified in Defendant’s Request for Admission (Set One).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In ruling on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court is limited to the material on
the face of the pleadings and materials that are judicially
noticeable.  “[A]dmissions or concessions of matters which cannot be
reasonably be controverted are properly considered on a motion for judgment on
the pleadings.”  (<i>Evans v. California
Trailer Court</i> (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549.)  In ruling on a motion for judgment on the
pleadings, a court “may consider matters which may be judicially noticed,
including a party’s admissions or concessions which can not reasonably be
controverted.”  (<i>Pang v. Beverly Hospital</i> (2000) 79
Cal.App.4th 986, 989-90.)  As the Court of Appeal stated in <i>Del E.
Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.</i> (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 593,
604-05, “The court will take judicial notice of records such as admissions,
answers to interrogatories, affidavits, and the like, when considering a
demurrer, only where they contain statements of the plaintiff or his agent
which are inconsistent with the allegations of the pleading before the
court.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The Court takes
judicial notice of its ruling on November 21, 2024, granting Defendant’s motion
for a deemed-admitted order.  “[A] deemed admitted order establishes,
by judicial fiat, that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by
admitting the truth of all matters contained therein.” (<i>Wilcox v.
Birtwhistle</i> (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff
is deemed to have admitted the truth of the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“(1)   REQUEST FOR
ADMISSION NO. 1: Admit YOU have no facts to support YOUR cause of action for
Negligence, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(2)   REQUEST FOR
ADMISSION NO. 2: Admit YOU have no facts to support YOUR cause of action for
Premises Liability, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(3)   REQUEST FOR
ADMISSION NO. 3: Admit YOU have no witnesses to support YOUR cause of action
for Negligence, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(4)   REQUEST FOR
ADMISSION NO. 4: Admit YOU have no witnesses to support YOUR cause of action
for Premises Liability, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(5)   REQUEST FOR
ADMISSION NO. 5: Admit YOU have no DOCUMENTS to support YOUR cause of action
for Negligence, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(6)   REQUEST FOR
ADMISSION NO. 6: Admit YOU have no DOCUMENTS to support YOUR cause of action
for Premises Liability, as asserted in YOUR Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(7)   REQUEST FOR
ADMISSION NO. 7: Admit YOU were not injured in the INCIDENT that occurred on
June 30, 2020, at the PREMISES as alleged in YOUR Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(8)   REQUEST FOR
ADMISSION NO. 8: Admit Defendant Alireza Shapoury is not liable for YOUR
alleged damages, as alleged in YOUR Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(9)   REQUEST FOR
ADMISSION NO. 9: Admit YOU have no damages as a result of the INCIDENT that
occurred on June 30, 2020, at the PREMISES as alleged in YOUR Complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(10)                   REQUEST
FOR ADMISSION NO. 10: Admit Defendant Alireza Shapoury did not cause any
damages to YOU as a result of the INCIDENT that occurred on June 30, 2020, at
the PREMISES as alleged in YOUR Complaint.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(Exh. 1.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff’s
admissions are inconsistent with the allegations in the complaint as to the
elements of the causes of action for negligence and premises liability. 
If the “proponent of the demurrer has shown that he has conclusively negated a
necessary element of plaintiffs’ cause of action, thereby demonstrating that
there is no factual basis for relief on any theory reasonably contemplated by
the pleadings,” then the demurrer must be sustained.  (<i>Sher v. Leiderman</i> (1986) 181 Cal.
App. 3d 867, 885-86.)  As discussed
above, the standard as to a demurrer equally applies to a motion for judgment
on the pleadings. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Because
Plaintiff admitted (or is deemed to have admitted) that he was not injured,
that he has no damages, and that Defendant is not liable, the causes of action
in Plaintiff’s complaint fail to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause
of action.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff has
not opposed the motion, sought to withdraw or amend his admissions, or sought
leave to amend.  Moreover, given the admissions, there is no likelihood
that Plaintiff could amend to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of
action.  The motion is granted without leave to amend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Conclusion</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sooferia, APC dba LA Smiles Dentistry (collectively, “Sooferi”) filed an answer
to the complaint.(Sooferian and Sooferi
are sometimes collectively referred to herein as “Defendants.”)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On
June 26, 2024, Sooferi filed a motion for summary judgment.On the same day, June 26, 2024, Sooferian

<p><span>After

<p><span>Minutes
before the hearing, Plaintiff filed an opposition.Among the documents filed by Plaintiff was a

<p><span>At
about the same time, Plaintiff filed this motion to seal Mr. Jaafari’s

<p><span>No

<p><b><u><span>Legal Standard</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

of [public] access to ordinary civil trials and proceedings.”(<i>NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Super.

closure of trial proceedings apply in the civil setting.”(<i>Ibid.</i>)Those standards are embodied in California
Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“Unless confidentiality is required by
law, court records are presumed to be open.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(c).“A record must not be filed under seal without a court order.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(a).)“The court must not permit a record to be
filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties.”(<i>Ibid.</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>California Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d)
sets forth the basic standard for an order permitting the filing of documents
under seal:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“The court may order that a record be
filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish:  </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(1) There exists an overriding interest
that overcomes the right of public access to the record;  </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(2) The overriding interest supports
sealing the record;  </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(3) A substantial probability exists
that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed;  </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(4) The proposed sealing is narrowly
tailored; and  </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(5) No less restrictive means exist to
achieve the overriding interest.”   </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).)  </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“An order sealing the record must: (A)
Specifically state the facts that support the findings; and (B) Direct the
sealing of only those documents and pages, or, if reasonably practicable,
portions of those documents and pages, that contain the material that needs to
be placed under seal. All other portions
of each document or page must be included in the public file.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.550(e)(1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>A motion or application to file under seal must be
accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to
justify the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1).)  “A request
to seal a document must be filed publicly and separately from the object of the
request.  It must be supported by a factual declaration or affidavit
explaining the particular needs of the case.” (<i>In re Marriage of Lechowick</i>
(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1416.) “[A]t a minimum that the party seeking to
seal documents, or maintain them under seal, must come forward with a specific
enumeration of the facts sought to be withheld and specific reasons for
withholding them.”  (<i>H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe</i> (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th
879, 894.) </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Discussion</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff
requests to file under seal a Declaration of Armand J. Jaafari. However,

justify the sealing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span><span>“The court

<p><span>This case was filed in June 2022. Plaintiff
did not serve Defendants until March 2024.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved in April 2024.
Plaintiff has not filed any document or appeared at any court proceeding since.
Plaintiff did not attend the Trial Setting Conferences held on May 31, 2024; July
2, 2024; August 14, 2024; October 17, 2024; or December 16, 2024. Plaintiff did
not attend the hearing on a prior motion to dismiss on December 13, 2024
(denied on procedural grounds). Plaintiff did not oppose the first motion to
dismiss or this second motion to dismiss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The Court has reviewed the file of this
action as well as the moving papers. The Court has considered each of the factors
set forth in the California Rules of Court, rule 3.1342(e). The Court has
considered the policies set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 583.130.
On this record, there appears to be a complete and total abandonment of the
case by Plaintiff, and the policy that a plaintiff must proceed with reasonable
diligence outweighs, under these circumstances, the policy in favor of
disposition of an action on the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><b><u><span>Background</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On
August 11, 2023, Kenneth Vandenberg (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
John Doe, Network Parking Inc., Curacao Ltd. (“Curacao”), and Does 1 through
50, asserting causes of action for battery, respondeat superior, and negligent
hiring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On
August 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint against the same
defendants asserting the same causes of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On
October 16, 2023, Curacao filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
All-American Protective Services, Inc. and Roes 1 through 50.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On
October 23 and 30, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Dwight Scott
as John Doe and All American Protective Services, Inc. as Doe 11.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On
February 14, 2024, Parking Network Inc. filed an answer and a cross-complaint
against Dwight Scott, All-American Protective Services, Inc., and Roes 1
through 50.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On
October 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against
Dwight Scott, All American Protective Services Inc., Parking Network Inc.,
Curacao, and Does 1 through 20, asserting causes of action for battery;
respondeat superior; negligent hiring, training, retention, assignment,
and or supervision; abuse of dependent adult; and violation of Civil Code
section 51.7.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On
November 20, 2024, Curacao filed this demurrer and motion to strike. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff’s
counsel filed a declaration regarding lack of service on December
6.  Curacao filed a reply on December 10.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
demurrer and motion to strike came on for hearing on December 18, 2024.The Court continued the hearing so that
counsel could satisfy the statutory meet-and-confer obligation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On
January 28, 2025, Plaintiff filed oppositions to the demurrer and motion to
strike.On February 3, 2025, Curacao
filed a reply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Legal
Standard</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Demurrer<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span>Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10 provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section
411.35.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>A general demurrer under Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e), tests whether the complaint states a
cause of action. (<i>Hahn v. Mirda</i></span></span><span></span><span><span>(2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see also 1 Weil &amp; Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial [2024], ¶ 7:40.)</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“We treat the demurrer as
admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law.We also
consider matters which may be judicially noticed.”(<i>Centinela Freeman Emergency Medical
Associates v. Health Net of California </i>(2016) 1 Cal.5th 994, 1010; <i>Blank
v. Kirwan </i>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord <i>Yvanova v. New Century
Mortgage Corp. </i>(2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; <i>Marina Pacific Hotel and
Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company </i>(2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 96, 104.)All reasonable inferences must be drawn in
favor of the pleading.(<i>Schifando v.
City of Los Angeles </i>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081; <i>Marina Pacific Hotel
and Suites, supra, </i>81 Cal.App.5th at p. 104.)Even “improbable” facts alleged in the
pleading must be accepted as true.(<i>Marina
Pacific Hotel and Suites, supra, </i>81 Cal.App.5th at pp. 104-105.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Courts must “liberally
construe the pleading” and “give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,
reading it as a whole and its parts in context.”(<i>Id. </i>at p. 105.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>A complaint must contain a
“statement of facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise
language.”(Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10,
subd. (a)(1); see also <i>C.A. v. William S. Hart High School Dist.</i> (2012)
53 Cal.4th 861, 872 [“the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state
a cause of action”].)Ordinarily, a
complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.”(<i>Doe v. City of Los Angeles</i> (2007) 42
Cal.4th 531, 550.)Ultimate facts are
those upon which “the right to recover depends” and are “essential” to the
cause of action.(<i>Estes v. Eaton
Corp. </i>(2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 636, 643 fn. 2; see also 1 Weil &amp; Brown, <i>supra</i>,
¶ 6:124.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>A plaintiff is required to
plead only “the essential facts of [its] case” that are sufficient “to acquaint
a defendant with the nature, source and extent of [the] cause of action.”(<i>Doe, supra, </i>42 Cal.4th at p.
550.)Mere boilerplate or pleading of
legal conclusions is not sufficient.(<i>Id.</i>
at p. 551 fn. 5.)But a plaintiff need
not allege “each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of
plaintiff’s proof” at trial.<i>(C.A.,
supra, </i>53 Cal.4th at p. 872.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>A
demurrer can be sustained only when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (<i>Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp.</i> (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; <i>Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency</i> (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Leave to amend should be
granted when “there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”(<i>Centinela Freeman,
supra, </i>1 Cal.5th at p. 1010; <i>Blank, supra, </i>39 Cal.3d at p. 318; <i>Shaeffer
v. Califia Farms </i>(2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1145.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Motion to Strike</span></i><i><span><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span><span>Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 435, “Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Code of Civil
Procedure section 436 provides:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435,
or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(b) Strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) In ruling on a motion to strike,
the court must assume the truth of the properly pleaded facts in the complaint
or other pleading. <i>(Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc</i>.
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Discussion</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff
alleges in the SAC that on June 3, 2023, he walked to the employee parking lot
for a Curacao Department Store, attempted to feed a stray cat, and was attacked
by Defendant Scott, the parking lot attendant. (SAC, ¶¶ 9-11.) Plaintiff
further alleges that at the time of the incident, he was a 64-year-old disabled
person.(<i>Id.</i>, ¶ 9.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Curacao
now brings this demurrer and motion to strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Demurrer<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span>Curacao
demurs to four causes of action in the SAC: the Second Cause of Action
(respondeat superior); the Third Cause of Action (negligent hiring, training,
retention, assignment and/or supervision); the Fourth Cause of Action (abuse of
dependent adult); and the Fifth Cause of Action (violation of Civil Code
section 51.7).The Court considers each
in turn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of
action of Plaintiff’s SAC. Curacao contends that Plaintiff has failed to
support with sufficient facts the second cause of action for Respondeat
Superior, third cause of action for Negligent Hiring, Training, Retention, and
Supervision, and fifth cause of action for violation of Civil Code section
51.7. Curacao contends that the fourth cause of action for Abuse of Dependent
Adult does not apply as Welfare &amp; Institutions Code section 15610 is
limited to residential care facilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff’s
SAC arises from an incident between Plaintiff and Dwight Scott (“Scott”), a
parking lot attendant where Plaintiff attempted to feed a stray cat. (SAC, ¶
10.) Plaintiff alleges Scott pushed Plaintiff to the ground and punched
Plaintiff as he tried to leave. (SAC, ¶ 11.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Second
Cause of Action (Respondeat Superior)<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span>The law regarding respondeat superior liability is well
established in California. A “principal is responsible to third persons for the
negligence of his agent in the transaction of the business of the agency,
including wrongful acts committed by such agent in and as part of the
transaction of such business.” (Civ. Code, § 2338.) “[A]n employer is
vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of
employment.” (<i>Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital </i>(1995) 12
Cal.4th 291, 296.) “The respondeat superior doctrine makes an employer liable,
irrespective of fault, for an employee’s tortious conduct in the scope of
employment.” (<i>Diaz v. Carcamo </i>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 1148, 1154.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>For more than 50 years, courts in
California have based respondeat superior liability not on a theory of control
by the employer but rather on the allocation of risk: a business is responsible
for the costs associated with the operations of the business, including the
tortious conduct of its employees that is “typical of or broadly incidental to
the enterprise [the employer] has undertaken,” the “more or less inevitable
toll of a lawful enterprise.”(<i>Hinman
v. Westinghouse Elec. Co.</i> (1970) 2 Cal.3d 956, 960.) The “risks inherent in
or created by the enterprise” are properly born by the employer, particularly
when the employee who committed the tort “was on company time and was engaged
in the very conduct contemplated by the employer.” (<i>Ibid.</i>; see also,
e.g., <i>Carr v. Wm C. Crowell Co.</i> (1946) 28 Cal.2d 652, 655-656 [referring
to the “risks of the enterprise”].) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In determining the scope of
employment, the California Supreme Court has adopted and repeatedly relied on a
standard set forth by the Court of Appeal in <i>Rodgers v. Kemper Construction
Co. </i>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 608, 618-619: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“One way to determine whether a risk is inherent
in, or created by, an enterprise is to ask whether the actual occurrence was a
generally foreseeable consequence of the activity. However, “foreseeability” in
this context must be distinguished from “foreseeability” as a test for
negligence.In the latter sense,
“foreseeable” means a level of probability which would lead a prudent person to
take effective precautions whereas “foreseeability” as a test for respondeat superior
merely means that in the context of the particular enterprise an employee’s
conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the
loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer’s business. … In other
words, where the question is one of vicarious liability, the inquiry should be
whether the risk was one that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly
incidental to the enterprise undertaken by the employer.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(See, e.g., <i>Lisa M., supra, </i>12
Cal.4th at p. 299 [quoting <i>Rodgers</i>]; <i>Farmers Ins. Group v. County of
Santa Clara </i>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 992, 1004 [same]; <i>Mary M. v. City of Los
Angeles </i>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 202, 209 [same]; see also CACI No. 3720 (stating
that conduct is within the scope of employment if it is “reasonably related to
the kinds of tasks that the [employee] was employed to perform” or “reasonably
foreseeable in light of the employer’s business or the [employee’s]
responsibilities.”) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“To hold an employer
vicariously liable the employee must be engaged in the duties which he was
employed to perform or those acts which incidentally or indirectly contribute
to the employer’s service.Conversely,
the employer is not liable when the employee is pursuing his own ends.”(<i>Tryer v. Ojai Valley School</i> (1992) 9
Cal.App.4th 1476, 1481 [citations and quotation marks omitted].)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In the context of
respondeat superior liability, courts construe “scope of employment”
broadly.(<i>Farmers Ins. Group, supra, </i>11
Cal.4th at p. 1004; <i>Jorge v. Culinary Institute of America </i>(2016) 3
Cal.App.5th 382, 385; <i>Jeewarat v. Warner Bros. Entertainment </i>(2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 427, 434.)“Where the
employee is combining his own business with that of his employer, or attending
to both at substantially the same time, no nice inquiry will be made as to
which business he was actually engaged in at the time of injury, unless it
clearly appears that neither directly or indirectly could he have been serving
his employer.”(<i>Farmers Ins. Group,
supra, </i>11 Cal.4th at p. 1004; accord <i>Perez v. Van Groningen &amp; Sons </i>(1986)
41 Cal.3d 962, 970; <i>Jorge, supra, </i>3 Cal.App.5th at p. 386; <i>Jeewarat,
supra, </i>177 Cal.App.4th at pp. 434-435.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant Scott was an agent or employee of Curacao.(SAC, ¶ 21.)Plaintiff alleges that when Defendant Scott attacked him, Defendant
Scott “was acting in the course and within the scope of his authority as agent
and employee, and in the transaction of the business of the employment or
agency.”(<i>Ibid.</i>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff
has set forth a sufficient pleading of the ultimate facts.Curacao contends that it was not the employer
of Defendant Scott and that Defendant Scott was not acting within the scope of
his duties, but the Court must accept as true the allegations of the SAC.If they are not true, Curacao will have an
adequate opportunity to develop a factual record and present its case at trial
(or, potentially, on summary judgment.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Third
Cause of Action (Negligent Hiring, Training, Retention, and Supervision)<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span>“California case law recognizes the theory that an employer
can be liable to a third person for negligently hiring, supervising, or
retaining an unfit employee.”(<i>Doe v.
Capital Cities</i> (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1054; accord <i>Evan F. v.
Hughson United Methodist Church </i>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 828, 836.)</span><span>“Negligence
liability will be imposed on an employer if it knew or should have known that
hiring the employee created a particular risk or hazard and that particular
harm materializes.”(<i>Phillips v. TLC
Plumbing, Inc.</i> (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1139.)</span><span>“Liability … is based upon the
reasoning that if an enterprise hires individuals with characteristics which
might pose a danger to customers or other employees, the enterprise should bear
the loss caused by the wrongdoing of its incompetent or unfit employees.”(<i>Mendoza v. City of Los Angeles </i>(1998)
66 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1339.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff
alleges that Curacao was the employer of Defendant Scott and knew or should
have known that Scott was incompetent and unfit to perform his duties and posed
an undue risk to Plaintiff and others.(SAC, ¶¶ 24-25.)Plaintiff
further alleges that despite its advance knowledge, Curacao retained Scott as
an employee in conscious disregard for the safety o of others.(SAC, ¶ 26.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff
has set forth a sufficient pleading of the ultimate facts.If these facts are not true, Curacao will
have an adequate opportunity to develop a factual record and present its case
at trial (or, potentially, on summary judgment.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
demurrer to the Third Cause of Action is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Fourth Cause
of Action (Abuse of Dependent Adult)</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Welfare and Institutions Code section 15657, part of the
Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (the “Elder Abuse Act”),
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“Where
it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant is liable for
physical abuse as defined in Section 15610.63, neglect as defined in Section
15610.57, or abandonment as defined in Section 15610.05, and that the defendant
has been guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in the commission
of this abuse, the following shall apply, in addition to all other remedies
otherwise provided by law:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(a) The
court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. The
term “costs” includes, but is not limited to, reasonable fees for the services
of a conservator, if any, devoted to the litigation of a claim brought under
this article.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(b) The
limitations imposed by Section 377.34 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the
damages recoverable shall not apply. However, the damages recovered shall not
exceed the damages permitted to be recovered pursuant to subdivision (b) of
Section 3333.2 of the Civil Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(c) The
standards set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 3294 of the Civil Code
regarding the imposition of punitive damages on an employer based upon the acts
of an employee shall be satisfied before any damages or attorney’s fees
permitted under this section may be imposed against an employer.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>A dependent adult, within the meaning of the Elder Abuse Act,
is a person “who has physical or mental limitations that restrict his or her
ability to carry out normal activities or to protect his or her rights” and
includes an adult “who is admitted as an inpatient to a 24-hour health facility.”(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, § 15610.23.)The Elder Abuse Act defines “physical abuse”
to include battery.(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code,
§ 15610.63, subd. (b).) “A battery
is any willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of
another.” (Pen. Code, § 242.)</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff alleges in the SAC that he was a
dependent adult at the time of the incident and that he suffered a
battery.(SAC, ¶¶ 28, 30-31.)</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In its demurrer to this cause of action,
Curacao makes essentially two arguments.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>First, Curacao argues that the civil
action provisions of the Elder Abuse Act apply only to a defendant that has the
care and custody of the elder.(Mem. at
pp. 10-11.)In support of this Curacao
cites </span><i><span>Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc.</span></i><span> (2016)
63 Cal.4th 148, but <i>Winn </i>does not support such a narrow reading of the
statute.Section 15657 provides for
heightened remedies for physical abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and the
California Supreme Court in <i>Winn </i>addressed only the meaning of the word neglect
in the statute.As to neglect, the court
stated: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“[The
Elder Abuse] Act does not apply unless the defendant health care provider had a
substantial caretaking or custodial relationship, involving ongoing
responsibility for one or more basic needs, with the elder patient.It is the nature of the elder or dependent
adult’s relationship with the defendant … that makes the defendant potentially
liable for neglect.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(63 Cal. 4th at p. 152.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges physical abuse, not
neglect.Accordingly, the limitations
set forth in <i>Winn </i>as to liability for neglect do not apply here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Second,
Curacao argues that the cause of action under the Elder Abuse Act is derivative
of the battery claim, and Plaintiff makes no claim of battery against
Curacao.(Mem., at p. 11.)But Plaintiff has alleged that Curacao is vicariously
liable for the alleged battery by Defendant Scott, and Curacao makes no argument
(and the Court is aware of no case law holding) that the ordinary principles of
vicarious liability do not apply to actions under the Elder Abuse Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The demurrer
to the Fourth Cause of Action is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Fifth
Cause of Action (Civil Code Section 51.7)<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span>Civil
Code section 51.7, known as the Ralph Civil Rights Act, provides in part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“All persons within the jurisdiction of this
state have the right to be free from any violence, or intimidation by threat of
violence, committed against their persons or property because of political
affiliation, or on account of any characteristic listed or defined in
subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51, or position in a labor dispute, or
because another person perceives them to have one or more of those
characteristics.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(Civ.
Code, § 51.7, subd. (b)(1).)The
characteristics listed or defined in Civil Code Section 51 include (among many
others) disability, medical condition, race, and color.(Civ. Code, § 51, subds. (b) &amp; (e).)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
elements of a cause of action under section 51.7 are: (1) that the defendant committed
or threatened to commit a violent act against the plaintiff; (2) that a substantial
motivating reason for the conduct was plaintiff’s protected characteristic (or the
defendant’s perception of plaintiff’s protected characteristic); (3) that the
plaintiff was harmed; and (4) that the defendant’s conduct was a
substantial factor in causing the plaintiff’s harm.(See <i>Gabrielle A. v. County of Orange </i>(2017)
10 Cal.App.5th 1268, 1291; <i>Austin B. v. Escondido Union School Dist.</i>
(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 860, 880-81; CACI 3063, 3064.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Plaintiff
alleges in the SAC that Defendant Scott committed a violent act against him and,
on information and belief, that Defendant Scott “was motivated by his perception
of plaintiff’s race and/or color and/or disability and/or medical condition
when he assaulted and battered plaintiff.”(SAC, ¶¶ 34-38.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In its
demurrer to this cause of action, Curacao makes essentially two arguments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>First,
Curacao argues that under the facts alleged in the SAC, section 51.7 does not
apply, that any act of violence by Defendant Scott was motivated by self-defense,
and if any violation occurred, Plaintiff was the perpetrator.(Mem. at pp. 12-13.)But the Court cannot determine, on demurrer,
whether Defendant Scott has a valid affirmative defense to this cause of action
(whether based on self-defense or otherwise) or what Defendant Scott’s true
motivation was.Plaintiff has alleged
that Defendant Scott attacked him and was motivated by his perception of
Plaintiff’s protected characteristics, and on demurrer the Court must accept
that allegation as true.A plaintiff may
plead a defendant’s state of mind in general terms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Second,
Curacao argues that the cause of action under section 51.7 is derivative of the
battery claim, and Plaintiff makes no claim of battery against Curacao.(Mem., at p. 13.)But Plaintiff has alleged that Curacao is vicariously
liable for the alleged battery by Defendant Scott, and Curacao makes no argument
(and the Court is aware of no case law holding) that the ordinary principles of
vicarious liability do not apply to actions under Civil Code section 51.7.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action is overruled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Motion to Strike<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span>Curacao
moves to strike the following thirteen items from Plaintiff’s SAC:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(1)</span></span><span>Plaintiffs
Second Cause of Action for Respondent Superior in its entirety as Defendant
Curacao did not employ nor control Defendant Scott; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(2)</span></span><span>Plaintiffs
Third Cause of Action for Negligent Hiring, Training, Retention, Assignment,
and/or Supervision as Defendant Curacao did not employ nor control Defendant
Scott, nor were the facts as stated by Plaintiff incidental to or consistent
with his job duties as a security guard; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(3)</span></span><span>Plaintiffs
Fourth Cause of Action for Abuse of Dependent Adult as the statute upon which
the claim is based Welfare &amp; Institutions Code, Section 15600 et. seq. are
inapplicable to tort claims occurring outside of a residential care facility in
which the Plaintiff was a patient; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(4)</span></span><span>Plaintiffs
Fourth Cause of Action for Abuse of Dependent Adult, based upon Welfare &amp;
Institutions Code, Section 15610.23 is parasitic to, and dependent upon, the
claim of Battery, a Cause of Action that Defendant Curacao is not included as a
party Defendant; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(5)</span></span><span>Plaintiffs
Fifth Cause of Action for violation of Civil Code, Section 51. 7 is
inapplicable to Defendant Curacao as Plaintiffs own actions in refusing
Defendant Scott's instructions to leave the employee parking garage were the
cause in fact of the incident, not some perceived pulmonary disability that no
one, other than the Plaintiff, could potentially know; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(6)</span></span><span>Plaintiffs
Fifth Cause of Action for violation of Civil Code, Section 51. 7 is parasitic
to, and dependent upon, the claim of Battery, a Cause of Action that Defendant
Curacao is not included as a party Defendant; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(7)</span></span><span>Paragraphs
8, 21, 22, 24, and 29 pertaining to the Plaintiff falsely claiming that
Defendant Scott as an employee of Defendant Curacao and two other Defendants; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(8)</span></span><span>Paragraphs
25, 26 &amp; 27 pertaining to Defendant Curacao having advanced knowledge of
potential harm caused by Defendant All American Protective Services Inc.,
hiring Defendant Scott;</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(9)</span></span><span>Paragraph
33 pertaining to Defendant Curacao "ratification" of Defendant
Scott's actions; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(10)</span></span><span>Paragraph
38 pertaining to Defendant Scott being able to perceive the pulmonary
disability of the Plaintiff; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(11)</span></span><span>Paragraphs
19, 27, 32, and Plaintiffs Prayer for Punitive Damages, page 9, number 3,
regarding Plaintiffs allegations pertaining to punitive damages; </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(12)</span></span><span>Paragraphs
32, 40 and Plaintiffs Prayer for Costs and Attorney's fees pursuant to Welfare
&amp; Institutions Code, Section 15657, page 9, Prayer Item No. 5; and </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>(13)</span></span><span>Paragraph
40 and Plaintiffs Prayer for a civil penalty and attorney fees pursuant to
Civil Code, Section 52, page 9-10, Prayer Item Nos. 6 and 7, regarding
Plaintiffs allegations of a civil penalty of $25,000.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>For the
same reasons set forth above in connection with the discussion of the demurrer,
the motion to strike is denied as to Items 1 through 6.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On a
motion to strike, the Court must accept the allegations of the complaint as
true.For this reason, the motion to
strike is denied as to Items 7 through 10.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
Court now turns to the issue of punitive damages, a civil penalty, attorney’s
fees, and costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Punitive
Damages<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p><span>To recover punitive
damages in a tort action, Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (a), requires
that a plaintiff prove by clear and convincing evidence “that the defendant has
been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.” In subdivision (c), the Legislature
defines the terms “oppression,” “fraud,” and “malice” for purposes of
recovering punitive damages under section 3294: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(1)
“Malice” means conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to
the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a
willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(2)
“Oppression” means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and
unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(3) “Fraud”
means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material
fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of
thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing
injury.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(Civ. Code, § 3294, subd.
(c)(1)-(3).) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The law is clear that
to </span><span>recover punitive damages in a tort action, Civil Code
section 3294 requires a plaintiff to prove by clear and convincing evidence
“that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.”(Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a); see also </span><span><span>(<i>College
Hosp., Inc. v. Super. Ct.</i> (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721; <i>Smith v. Super. Ct.</i>
(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.) </span></span><span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span>“Malice” is defined in section
3294, subdivision (c)(1), as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“Oppression” is defined in
section 3294, subdivision (c)(2), as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“Fraud” is defined in section
3294, subdivision (c)(3), as “</span><span>an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”<span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span>The term “despicable conduct,” as used in subdivisions (c)(1) and
(c)(2), has been defined in thecase
law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (See, e.g., </span><i><span>College Hospital, supra,</span></i><span> 8 Cal.4th at p. 725; <i><span>Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales &amp;
Marketing, Inc.</span></i><span> (2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th
847, 891; </span>see also CACI 3940 [“Despicable conduct is conduct that is so
vile, base, or contemptible that it would be looked down on and despised by
reasonable people.”].<span>)</span></span><span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The
basis for punitive damages must be pleaded with particularity; conclusory
allegations devoid of any factual assertions are insufficient. (<i>Ibid.</i>;
see also <i>Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. v. Snepp</i> (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 598, 643.) A motion to strike may also lie where the facts alleged,
if proven, would not support a finding that the defendant acted with malice,
fraud, or oppression. (</span></span><i><span>Today IV’s Inc. v. Los Angeles County MTA</span></i><span> (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th
1137, 1193; </span><span><i><span>Turman, supra, </span></i></span><span><span>191 Cal. App. 4th at p. 63.)</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Pleading
negligence, gross negligence, or even recklessness is not sufficient. (<i>Dawes
v. Super. Ct.</i> (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 82, 87.) Rather, a plaintiff must
allege facts demonstrating that the defendant intended to cause harm to
plaintiff or “acted in such an outrageous and reprehensible manner that the
jury could infer that [the defendant] knowingly disregarded the substantial
certainty of injury to others.” (<i>Id.</i> at p. 90; see also, e.g., </span><i><span>American
Airlines, Inc. v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton</span></i><span> (2002)
96 Cal.App.4th 1017.</span><span>).</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>As against Curacao,
Plaintiff seeks to recover punitive damages under a theory of <span>vicarious liability theory (that is, Plaintiffs seek
punitive damages against Curacao as employer or principal for the conduct of
its employee or agent).Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
claim for punitive damages is governed by Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b).That subdivision provides: <o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><span>“An employer
shall not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a) [i.e., punitive
damages], based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the employer
had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her
with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or
ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was
personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate
employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization,
ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.”</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
Court has reviewed the SAC and considered the arguments presented by each side.The Court concludes that Plaintiff has not pleaded,
with particularity, a basis to recover punitive damages.Plaintiff’s general pleading is not sufficient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
motion to strike the punitive damages allegations, as against Curacao, is
granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Because the
basis of the ruling is a failure to allege a basis to recover punitive damages
with sufficient particularity, the motion is granted with leave to amend.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Civil Penalty</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In his Fifth Cause of
Action, Plaintiff seeks to recover a civil penalty under Civil Code section 52,
subdivision (b)(2).Curacao moves to
strike the references to a civil penalty, but it provides no substantial argument
in support of this request in its memorandum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The motion to strike the civil
penalty allegation, as against Curacao, is denied. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Attorney’s Fees</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In his Fourth and Fifth
Causes of Action, Plaintiff seeks to recover attorney’s fees under Welfare and
Institutions Code section 15657, subdivision (a), and Civil Code section 52,
subdivision (b)(3).Curacao moves to
strike the references to attorney’s fees, but it provides no substantial argument
in support of this request in its memorandum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The motion to strike the attorney’s
fees allegations, as against Curacao, are denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><i><span>Costs</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In his Fourth Causes of
Action, Plaintiff seeks to recover costs under Welfare and Institutions Code
section 15657, subdivision (a).Curacao
moves to strike the references to costs, but it provides no substantial argument
in support of this request in its memorandum.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The motion to strike the costs
allegations, as against Curacao, are denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Conclusion</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
Court OVERRULES Curacao’s demurrer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The
Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Curacao’s motion to strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>The

<p><b><u><span>Background</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On October
19, 2023, Nicole McElroy (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Anthony
Villasenor (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50 for motor vehicle negligence and
general negligence arising out of an alleged accident on July 5, 2022.When the case was filed, the Court assigned a
trial date of April 17, 2025.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Defendant
was served in October 2024.On November
12, 2024, Defendant filed an answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On January 2,
2025, Defendant filed this motion to vacate trial and final status conference
date based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with California Rules of Court,
rule 3.110 or, in the alternative, to continue trial. No opposition has been
filed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Legal Standard</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>California Rules of Court, rule 3.110 states
a “complaint must be served on all named defendants and proofs of service on
those defendants must be filed with the court within 60 days after the filing
of the complaint. When the complaint is amended to add a defendant, the added
defendant must be served and proof of service must be filed within 30 days
after the filing of the amended complaint.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (<i>Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams</i> (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (<i>Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens</i> (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm.All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)“The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”(<i>Ibid.</i>) Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(3) The length
of the continuance requested;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or

<p><b><u><span>Discussion</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Defendant seeks to vacate or continue the April
17, 2025 trial date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Defendant was served in October 2024, about a
year after the complaint was filed.With
a trial date of April 2025, Defendant states that he does not have time to complete
discovery and prepare for trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Given the delay in service, Defendant has
shown good cause for a trial continuance.The Court, in its discretion, declines to vacate the trial date and set
a Trial Setting Conference, as a trial continuance is sufficient to protect
Defendant from any unfair prejudice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The Court finds good cause to continue trial
to early October 2025.On this record,
the Court finds that this should give Defendant more than sufficient time to complete
discovery and prepare for trial.If,
however, there are unexpected delays, Defendant may seek a further continuance
in the future (either by motion or stipulation) based on a further showing of
good cause.<span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Conclusion</span></u></b><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
