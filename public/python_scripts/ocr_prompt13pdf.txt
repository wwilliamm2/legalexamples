Hi,
Please study the text in the attached document and use your semantic knowledge
to fix typos made by OCR software. For example hel1o should be changed to
hello and $1o,42m3.OQ should be $10,4233.00.
Sacramento Coimty should be Sacramento County.
If you encounter a word which fails spell-check but visually resembles a valid
word, please consider that you have just encountered an OCR-typo.
I offer you 4 more examples of OCR typos which I found using my semantic knowledge:
'''Tmstee should be Trustee, Febmary should be February, tme should be true, or time or tame or me.'''
After you correct the typos in that text,
Please extract the corrected text, verbatim, from your context,
and show it to me.
I want to copy and paste that corrected text into my editor to check it for spelling errors.
Thanks!

If you detect text which might be a Caption,
please format the text in your response
so it matches the old-style (pre 1980)
of Captions written to page 1 of legal documents
which were written by typewriters.
I describe a Caption format as a table with 3 rows.
Row 1 has 2 columns which name the author on the left and court-clerk filing info on the right.
Row 2 has 1 column which centers a California Court name.
Row 3 has 2 columns which names parties on the left and Document info and Case info on the right.
Thanks!
