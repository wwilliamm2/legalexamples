And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a lawsuit between Lilit Keshishyan, Levon Ehtibaryan, and HG Law, represented by Hyka A. Karapetian. The lawsuit arises from a personal injury action that was settled without the plaintiffs' knowledge or consent. The court rules that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The court also rules that the defendants' motion to strike is denied as moot. The court finds that the plaintiffs' complaint is uncertain and fails to state a claim for fraud. The court grants the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' third cause of action, alleging fraud.
