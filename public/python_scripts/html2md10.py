gpt, Please search the web for Python software I can use to convert HTML syntax to Markdown syntax.

ANSWER:
Several Python libraries are available for converting HTML to Markdown:

1. html-to-markdown: A modern, fully typed Python library for converting HTML to Markdown. It offers complete type safety, a functional API design, and extensive test coverage[4].

2. markdownify: A popular package that provides a simple way to convert HTML text to Markdown format[1].

3. pyhtml2md: A Python wrapper for the html2md C++ library, offering fast and reliable HTML to Markdown conversion[6].

4. BeautifulSoup with html2text: While not a dedicated converter, this combination can be used to process HTML before converting it to Markdown[8].

5. Pandoc: Although not a Python library itself, Pandoc can be used with a Python wrapper to convert HTML to Markdown[7].

To use these libraries, you typically need to install them via pip. For example:

```python
pip install html-to-markdown
```

Then, you can use them in your Python code. Here's a basic example using html-to-markdown:

```python
from html_to_markdown import convert_to_markdown

html = '<h1>Hello, world!</h1><p>This is a <strong>sample</strong>.</p>'
markdown = convert_to_markdown(html)
print(markdown)
```

These libraries offer various customization options and features to handle different HTML structures and produce the desired Markdown output[1][4][6].
