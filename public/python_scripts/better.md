PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT ALL COMMUNICATIONS WITH COURT STAFF DEAL ONLY WITH SCHEDULING AND ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS AND DO NOT DISCUSS THE MERITS OF ANY CASE. (UPDATED 6/17/2020\) IMPORTANT:  In light of the COVID\-19 emergency, the Court encourages all parties to appear remotely.  The capacity in the courtroom is extremely limited.  The Court appreciates the cooperation of counsel and the litigants.  **ALSO NOTE**:  If the moving party does not contact the court to submit on the tentative and does not appear (either remotely or in person), the motion will be taken off calendar.  THE TENTATIVE RULING WILL NOT BE THE ORDER OF THE COURT.  ---    **Case Number:**  21STCV11137    **Hearing Date:**  February 10, 2025    **Dept:**  29 Gonzalez v. J \& B Management, LLC 21STCV11137 Defendant’s Motion to Continue Trial  **Tentative** The motion is denied. **Background** On March 22, 2021, Carolina Gonzalez and Carlos Victor (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against J\&B Management, LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 25, asserting causes of action for premises liability, loss of consortium, and negligent infliction of emotional distress, all arising out of slip and fall incident on March 22, 2019\.   On July 31, 2023, Defendant filed an answer.   On January 16, 2025, Defendant this motion to continue trial.  No opposition has been filed.  While this motion was pending, the Court, on January 23, 2025, the Court granted in part Defendant’s ex parte application to continue trial.Defendant had requested a continuance of the trial date from February 24 to June 10, 2025; the Court granted a continuance of 30 days and set trial for March 26, 2025\. When this case was filed, the Court set a trial date of September 19, 2022\.That trial date was vacated.At a trial setting conference in November 2023, the Court set a trial date of February 24, 2025\. **Legal Standard** Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(8\), provides that the court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (*Color\-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams* (1996\) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603\.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (*Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens* (1975\) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18\.) “To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm.All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as certain.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(a).) “Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(c).)“The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.”(*Ibid.*) Circumstances that may support a finding of good cause include: “(1\) The unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (2\) The unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (3\) The unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (4\) The substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in the interests of justice; (5\) The addition of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's involvement in the case; (6\) A party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; or (7\) A significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(c).) “In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the determination.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(d).)California Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(d) sets forth a non\-exhaustive list of factors that the court may consider: “(1\) The proximity of the trial date; (2\) Whether there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3\) The length of the continuance requested; (4\) The availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a continuance; (5\) The prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;  (6\) If the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay;  (7\) The court's calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials;  (8\) Whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9\) Whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; (10\) Whether the interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and (11\) Any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(d).)  “A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (*Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court* (1989\) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord *Cole v. Superior Court* (2022\) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88\.) **Discussion** As a threshold matter, the motion was not timely served.When a motion is personally served, the motion must be served 16 court days before the hearing; when the motion is electronically served, two additional court days are added.(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b) \& § 1010\.6, subd. (a)(3\).) For a motion hearing on February 10, 2025, the last day for personal service was January 16, 2025\.The last day for electronic service was January 14, 2025\. Here, the motion was electronically served on January 16, 2025\.That is late.For that reason, the motion is denied. Separately and independently, the motion is also denied on the merits.Defendant appeared in this action more than 18 months ago and has had more than an adequate amount of time to conduct and complete discovery (and to bring any discovery motions, as needed).The Court, by ex parte application filed while this motion was pending, granted a trial continuance of 30 days.Defendant has not shown good cause for any further continuance of the trial date so that the parties can conduct discovery. **Conclusion** The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to continue trial. Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.  ---   **Case Number:**  22STCV07478    **Hearing Date:**  February 10, 2025    **Dept:**  29 Guevara v. Shapoury 22STCV07478 Defendant’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings  **Tentative** The motion is granted. **Background** On March 1, 2022, Jose Guevara (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Alireza Shapoury (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 100, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises liability arising out of an injury that allegedly occurred while plaintiff was performing yardwork for Defendant on June 30, 2020\. On May 15, 2023, Defendant filed an answer. On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case. On July 29, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved as attorney of record. On November 21, 2024, the Court set the trial for March 3, 2025\.  On the same date, the Court granted Defendant’s motion to deem Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admission (Set One). On December 5, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for judgment on the pleadings, along with a request for judicial notice. No opposition has been filed. The motion came on for hearing on January 10, 2025\.  After hearing from both sides, the Court continued the hearing to February 10, 2025\. Nothing has been filed in the interim.  **Legal Standard** A defendant may move for judgment on the pleadings when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (c)(1\)(B)(ii).)  “A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed. Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”  (*Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp*. (1998\) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999\.)  “The standard for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  (*Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly* (2010\) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321\-322; accord *Los Angeles Unified School Dist. v. Torres Construction Corp.*(2020\) 57 Cal.App.5th 480, 494; *Templo v. State*(2018\) 24 Cal.App.5th 730, 735; *Schabarum v. California Legislature* (1998\) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216; see also 1 Weil \& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial \[2024] ¶ 7:275\.)  **Discussion** Plaintiff asserts causes of action for negligence and premises liability. The basic elements of a cause of action for negligence and for premises liability are the same: (1\) the existence of a legal duty; (2\) breach of that duty; (3\) causation; and (4\) resulting damages. (*Brown v. USA Taekwondo* (2021\) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; *Kesner v. Superior Court* (2016\) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; *Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp* (2013\) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998\.) Defendant now moves for judgment on the pleadings.  The motion is based on the prior order of the Court deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Defendant’s Request for Admission (Set One). In ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, the Court is limited to the material on the face of the pleadings and materials that are judicially noticeable.  “\[A]dmissions or concessions of matters which cannot be reasonably be controverted are properly considered on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.”  (*Evans v. California Trailer Court* (1994\) 28 Cal.App.4th 540, 549\.)  In ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings, a court “may consider matters which may be judicially noticed, including a party’s admissions or concessions which can not reasonably be controverted.”  (*Pang v. Beverly Hospital* (2000\) 79 Cal.App.4th 986, 989\-90\.)  As the Court of Appeal stated in *Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co.* (1981\) 123 Cal. App. 3d 593, 604\-05, “The court will take judicial notice of records such as admissions, answers to interrogatories, affidavits, and the like, when considering a demurrer, only where they contain statements of the plaintiff or his agent which are inconsistent with the allegations of the pleading before the court.”  The Court takes judicial notice of its ruling on November 21, 2024, granting Defendant’s motion for a deemed\-admitted order.  “\[A] deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial fiat, that a nonresponding party has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all matters contained therein.” (*Wilcox v. Birtwhistle* (1999\) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979\.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff is deemed to have admitted the truth of the following: “(1\)   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 1: Admit YOU have no facts to support YOUR cause of action for Negligence, as asserted in YOUR Complaint. (2\)   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 2: Admit YOU have no facts to support YOUR cause of action for Premises Liability, as asserted in YOUR Complaint. (3\)   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 3: Admit YOU have no witnesses to support YOUR cause of action for Negligence, as asserted in YOUR Complaint. (4\)   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 4: Admit YOU have no witnesses to support YOUR cause of action for Premises Liability, as asserted in YOUR Complaint. (5\)   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 5: Admit YOU have no DOCUMENTS to support YOUR cause of action for Negligence, as asserted in YOUR Complaint. (6\)   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 6: Admit YOU have no DOCUMENTS to support YOUR cause of action for Premises Liability, as asserted in YOUR Complaint. (7\)   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 7: Admit YOU were not injured in the INCIDENT that occurred on June 30, 2020, at the PREMISES as alleged in YOUR Complaint. (8\)   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 8: Admit Defendant Alireza Shapoury is not liable for YOUR alleged damages, as alleged in YOUR Complaint. (9\)   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 9: Admit YOU have no damages as a result of the INCIDENT that occurred on June 30, 2020, at the PREMISES as alleged in YOUR Complaint. (10\)                   REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. 10: Admit Defendant Alireza Shapoury did not cause any damages to YOU as a result of the INCIDENT that occurred on June 30, 2020, at the PREMISES as alleged in YOUR Complaint.” (Exh. 1\.) Plaintiff’s admissions are inconsistent with the allegations in the complaint as to the elements of the causes of action for negligence and premises liability.  If the “proponent of the demurrer has shown that he has conclusively negated a necessary element of plaintiffs’ cause of action, thereby demonstrating that there is no factual basis for relief on any theory reasonably contemplated by the pleadings,” then the demurrer must be sustained.  (*Sher v. Leiderman* (1986\) 181 Cal. App. 3d 867, 885\-86\.)  As discussed above, the standard as to a demurrer equally applies to a motion for judgment on the pleadings.  Because Plaintiff admitted (or is deemed to have admitted) that he was not injured, that he has no damages, and that Defendant is not liable, the causes of action in Plaintiff’s complaint fail to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.   Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted. Plaintiff has not opposed the motion, sought to withdraw or amend his admissions, or sought leave to amend.  Moreover, given the admissions, there is no likelihood that Plaintiff could amend to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action.  The motion is granted without leave to amend. **Conclusion** The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.  ---   **Case Number:**  22STCV09370    **Hearing Date:**  February 10, 2025    **Dept:**  29 Embray v. Sooferi 22STCV09370 Plaintiff’s Motion to File Under Seal    **Tentative** The motion is denied without prejudice on procedural grounds. **Background** On March 16, 2022, Plaintiff Jacquith Embray (“Plaintiff”) filed the complaint in this action against Defendants Pedram Sooferi, D.D.S, individually and dba LA Smiles Dentistry; Sean Sooferian, D.D.S.; and Does 1 through 50, asserting one cause of action for professional negligence based on events occurring during a visit to Defendants’ dental office on March 18, 2021\.  On September 7, 2023, Sean Sooferian, D.D.S. (“Sooferian”) filed an answer to the complaint. On September 19, 2023, Pedram Sooferi, D.D.S. and Sooferi and Sooferia, APC dba LA Smiles Dentistry (collectively, “Sooferi”) filed an answer to the complaint.(Sooferian and Sooferi are sometimes collectively referred to herein as “Defendants.”) On June 26, 2024, Sooferi filed a motion for summary judgment.On the same day, June 26, 2024, Sooferian filed a joinder. After several continuances, the motion was set for hearing on January 10, 2025\. Minutes before the hearing, Plaintiff filed an opposition.Among the documents filed by Plaintiff was a declaration from counsel, Armand J. Jaafari. At about the same time, Plaintiff filed this motion to seal Mr. Jaafari’s declaration. No opposition has been filed. **Legal Standard** “\[T]he First Amendment provides a right of \[public] access to ordinary civil trials and proceedings.”(*NBC Subsidiary (KNBC\-TV), Inc. v. Super. Ct.* (1999\) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212\.) “\[C]onstitutional standards governing closure of trial proceedings apply in the civil setting.”(*Ibid.*)Those standards are embodied in California Rules of Court, rules 2\.550 and 2\.551\. “Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2\.550(c).“A record must not be filed under seal without a court order.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2\.551(a).)“The court must not permit a record to be filed under seal based solely on the agreement or stipulation of the parties.”(*Ibid.*) California Rules of Court, rule 2\.550(d) sets forth the basic standard for an order permitting the filing of documents under seal: “The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish:   (1\) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;   (2\) The overriding interest supports sealing the record;   (3\) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed;   (4\) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and   (5\) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”    (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2\.550(d).)   “An order sealing the record must: (A) Specifically state the facts that support the findings; and (B) Direct the sealing of only those documents and pages, or, if reasonably practicable, portions of those documents and pages, that contain the material that needs to be placed under seal. All other portions of each document or page must be included in the public file.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2\.550(e)(1\). A motion or application to file under seal must be accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2\.551(b)(1\).)  “A request to seal a document must be filed publicly and separately from the object of the request.  It must be supported by a factual declaration or affidavit explaining the particular needs of the case.” (*In re Marriage of Lechowick* (1998\) 65 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1416\.) “\[A]t a minimum that the party seeking to seal documents, or maintain them under seal, must come forward with a specific enumeration of the facts sought to be withheld and specific reasons for withholding them.”  (*H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe* (2007\) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894\.)  **Discussion** Plaintiff requests to file under seal a Declaration of Armand J. Jaafari. However, Plaintiff fails to include a declaration or affidavit addressing the facts to justify the sealing. Plaintiff has failed to file all the required documents in accordance with California Rules of Court, rule 2\.551(b)(1\). Plaintiff has failed to comply (or at least presented no proof of compliance) with Rule 2\.551(b)(2\). Plaintiff has failed to comply with Rule 2\.551(b)(4\). Plaintiff has failed to comply with Rule 2\.551(b)(5\).No redacted version of the Declaration of Armand J. Jaafari has been filed or submitted. The motion is denied without prejudice.Because of the strong presumption of public access to court records, strict compliance with Rules of Court, rule 2\.550 and 2\.551, is required. **Conclusion** The Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff’s motion to file under seal. Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  ---   **Case Number:**  22STCV19757    **Hearing Date:**  February 10, 2025    **Dept:**  29 Becerra v. MV Transportation, Inc. 22STCV19757 Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Prosecute  **Tentative** The motion is granted. **Background** On June 16, 2022, Maria Becerra (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against MV Transportation, Inc. (“MV”), LADOT Transit (“LADOT”), City of Los Angeles (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), and Does 1 to 100 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence.  On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request to dismiss County. Also on April 3, 2024, the Court granted the motion of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved as counsel. On April 15, 2024, MV filed an answer. On May 3, 2024, LADOT and City filed an answer.  On December 19, 2024, MV, LADOT, and City (collectively “Defendants”) filed this motion to dismiss. Plaintiff was served by mail.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.  **Legal Standard** Code of Civil Procedure section 583\.410 states:  “(a) The court may in its discretion dismiss an action for delay in prosecution pursuant to this article on its own motion or on motion of the defendant if to do so appears to the court appropriate under the circumstances of the case. (b) Dismissal shall be pursuant to the procedure and in accordance with the criteria prescribed by rules adopted by the Judicial Council.” Code of Civil Procedure section 583\.420 provides, in part:¿ “(a) The court may not dismiss an action pursuant to this article for delay in prosecution except after one of the following conditions has occurred:¿ (1\) Service is not made within two years after the action is commenced against the defendant.¿¿ (2\) The action is not brought to trial within the following times:¿¿ (A) Three years after the action is commenced against the defendant unless otherwise prescribed by rule under subparagraph (B).¿¿ (B) Two years after the action is commenced against the defendant if the Judicial Council by rule adopted pursuant to Section 583\.410 so prescribes for the court because of the condition of the court calendar or for other reasons affecting the conduct of litigation or the administration of justice.¿ California Rules of Court, rule 3\.1340(a) provides:  “The court on its own motion or on motion of the defendant may dismiss an action under Code of Civil Procedure sections 583\.410\-583\.430 for delay in prosecution if the action has not been brought to trial or conditionally settled within two years after the action was commenced against the defendant.” California Rules of Court, rule 3\.1342(a) requires that a party seeking dismissal under sections 583\.410 through 583\.430 to serve and file a motion at least 45 days before the hearing date. Rule 3\.1342(e) provides: “In ruling on the motion, the court must consider all matters relevant to a proper determination of the motion, including: ¿(1\)¿The court's file in the case and the declarations and supporting data submitted by the parties and, where applicable, the availability of the moving party and other essential parties for service of process; (2\) ¿The diligence in seeking to effect service of process; (3\) ¿The extent to which the parties engaged in any settlement negotiations or discussions; (4\) ¿The diligence of the parties in pursuing discovery or other pretrial proceedings, including any extraordinary relief sought by either party; (5\) ¿The nature and complexity of the case; (6\) ¿The law applicable to the case, including the pendency of other litigation under a common set of facts or determinative of the legal or factual issues in the case; (7\) ¿The nature of any extensions of time or other delay attributable to either party; (8\) ¿The condition of the court's calendar and the availability of an earlier trial date if the matter was ready for trial; (9\) ¿Whether the interests of justice are best served by dismissal or trial of the case; and (10\) ¿Any other fact or circumstance relevant to a fair determination of the issue. The court must be guided by the policies set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 583\.130\.” Section 583\.130 recognizes, among other things, the policy “that a plaintiff shall proceed with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of an action” and the policy “favoring trial or other disposition of an action on the merits.” (See also, e.g., *Van Keulen v. Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd.* (2008\) 162 Cal.App.4th 122, 131\.)¿¿ **Discussion** This case was filed in June 2022\. Plaintiff did not serve Defendants until March 2024\. Plaintiff’s counsel was relieved in April 2024\. Plaintiff has not filed any document or appeared at any court proceeding since. Plaintiff did not attend the Trial Setting Conferences held on May 31, 2024; July 2, 2024; August 14, 2024; October 17, 2024; or December 16, 2024\. Plaintiff did not attend the hearing on a prior motion to dismiss on December 13, 2024 (denied on procedural grounds). Plaintiff did not oppose the first motion to dismiss or this second motion to dismiss. The Court has reviewed the file of this action as well as the moving papers. The Court has considered each of the factors set forth in the California Rules of Court, rule 3\.1342(e). The Court has considered the policies set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 583\.130\. On this record, there appears to be a complete and total abandonment of the case by Plaintiff, and the policy that a plaintiff must proceed with reasonable diligence outweighs, under these circumstances, the policy in favor of disposition of an action on the merits. The motion to dismiss is granted.  **Conclusion** The Court GRANTS Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Court ORDERS that this complaint in this action is dismissed in its entirety without prejudice. Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  ---   **Case Number:**  23STCV02145    **Hearing Date:**  February 10, 2025    **Dept:**  29 Edwards v.

Doe 23STCV19149 Demurrer and Motion to Strike filed by Defendant Curacao Ltd. **Tentative** The demurrer is overruled. The motion to strike is granted in part (with leave to amend) and denied in part. **Background** On August 11, 2023, Kenneth Vandenberg (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against John Doe, Network Parking Inc., Curacao Ltd. (“Curacao”), and Does 1 through 50, asserting causes of action for battery, respondeat superior, and negligent hiring. On August 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint against the same defendants asserting the same causes of action. On October 16, 2023, Curacao filed an answer and a cross\-complaint against All\-American Protective Services, Inc. and Roes 1 through 50\. On October 23 and 30, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Dwight Scott as John Doe and All American Protective Services, Inc. as Doe 11\. On February 14, 2024, Parking Network Inc. filed an answer and a cross\-complaint against Dwight Scott, All\-American Protective Services, Inc., and Roes 1 through 50\. On October 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed the Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against Dwight Scott, All American Protective Services Inc., Parking Network Inc., Curacao, and Does 1 through 20, asserting causes of action for battery; respondeat superior; negligent hiring, training, retention, assignment, and or supervision; abuse of dependent adult; and violation of Civil Code section 51\.7\. On November 20, 2024, Curacao filed this demurrer and motion to strike.  Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration regarding lack of service on December 6\.  Curacao filed a reply on December 10\. The demurrer and motion to strike came on for hearing on December 18, 2024\.The Court continued the hearing so that counsel could satisfy the statutory meet\-and\-confer obligation. On January 28, 2025, Plaintiff filed oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike.On February 3, 2025, Curacao filed a reply. **Legal Standard** *Demurrer* Code of Civil Procedure section 430\.10 provides: “The party against whom a complaint or cross\-complaint has been filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430\.30, to the pleading on any one or more of the following grounds: (a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the pleading. (b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the legal capacity to sue. (c) There is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action. (d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties. (e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision, “uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible. (g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct. (h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411\.35\.” A general demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure section 430\.10, subdivision (e), tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (*Hahn v. Mirda*(2007\) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see also 1 Weil \& Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial \[2024], ¶ 7:40\.) “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.”(*Centinela Freeman Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California* (2016\) 1 Cal.5th 994, 1010; *Blank v. Kirwan* (1985\) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord *Yvanova v. New Century Mortgage Corp.* (2016\) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; *Marina Pacific Hotel and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company* (2022\) 81 Cal.App.5th 96, 104\.)All reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the pleading.(*Schifando v. City of Los Angeles* (2003\) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081; *Marina Pacific Hotel and Suites, supra,* 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 104\.)Even “improbable” facts alleged in the pleading must be accepted as true.(*Marina Pacific Hotel and Suites, supra,* 81 Cal.App.5th at pp. 104\-105\.) Courts must “liberally construe the pleading” and “give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in context.”(*Id.* at p. 105\.) A complaint must contain a “statement of facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.”(Code Civ. Proc., § 425\.10, subd. (a)(1\); see also *C.A. v. William S. Hart High School Dist.* (2012\) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872 \[“the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action”].)Ordinarily, a complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.”(*Doe v. City of Los Angeles* (2007\) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550\.)Ultimate facts are those upon which “the right to recover depends” and are “essential” to the cause of action.(*Estes v. Eaton Corp.* (2020\) 51 Cal.App.5th 636, 643 fn. 2; see also 1 Weil \& Brown, *supra*, ¶ 6:124\.) A plaintiff is required to plead only “the essential facts of \[its] case” that are sufficient “to acquaint a defendant with the nature, source and extent of \[the] cause of action.”(*Doe, supra,* 42 Cal.4th at p. 550\.)Mere boilerplate or pleading of legal conclusions is not sufficient.(*Id.* at p. 551 fn. 5\.)But a plaintiff need not allege “each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of plaintiff’s proof” at trial.*(C.A., supra,* 53 Cal.4th at p. 872\.) A demurrer can be sustained only when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (*Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.* (2007\) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; *Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency* (2003\) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046\.) Leave to amend should be granted when “there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”(*Centinela Freeman, supra,* 1 Cal.5th at p. 1010; *Blank, supra,* 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; *Shaeffer v. Califia Farms* (2020\) 44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1145\.) *Motion to Strike* Under Code of Civil Procedure section 435, “Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1\).) Code of Civil Procedure section 436 provides: “The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436\.) In ruling on a motion to strike, the court must assume the truth of the properly pleaded facts in the complaint or other pleading. *(Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc*. (2010\) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63\.) **Discussion** Plaintiff alleges in the SAC that on June 3, 2023, he walked to the employee parking lot for a Curacao Department Store, attempted to feed a stray cat, and was attacked by Defendant Scott, the parking lot attendant. (SAC, ¶¶ 9\-11\.) Plaintiff further alleges that at the time of the incident, he was a 64\-year\-old disabled person.(*Id.*, ¶ 9\.) Curacao now brings this demurrer and motion to strike. *Demurrer* Curacao demurs to four causes of action in the SAC: the Second Cause of Action (respondeat superior); the Third Cause of Action (negligent hiring, training, retention, assignment and/or supervision); the Fourth Cause of Action (abuse of dependent adult); and the Fifth Cause of Action (violation of Civil Code section 51\.7\).The Court considers each in turn. the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action of Plaintiff’s SAC. Curacao contends that Plaintiff has failed to support with sufficient facts the second cause of action for Respondeat Superior, third cause of action for Negligent Hiring, Training, Retention, and Supervision, and fifth cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 51\.7\. Curacao contends that the fourth cause of action for Abuse of Dependent Adult does not apply as Welfare \& Institutions Code section 15610 is limited to residential care facilities. Plaintiff’s SAC arises from an incident between Plaintiff and Dwight Scott (“Scott”), a parking lot attendant where Plaintiff attempted to feed a stray cat. (SAC, ¶ 10\.) Plaintiff alleges Scott pushed Plaintiff to the ground and punched Plaintiff as he tried to leave. (SAC, ¶ 11\.) *Second Cause of Action (Respondeat Superior)* The law regarding respondeat superior liability is well established in California. A “principal is responsible to third persons for the negligence of his agent in the transaction of the business of the agency, including wrongful acts committed by such agent in and as part of the transaction of such business.” (Civ. Code, § 2338\.) “\[A]n employer is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of employment.” (*Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital* (1995\) 12 Cal.4th 291, 296\.) “The respondeat superior doctrine makes an employer liable, irrespective of fault, for an employee’s tortious conduct in the scope of employment.” (*Diaz v. Carcamo* (2011\) 51 Cal.4th 1148, 1154\.) For more than 50 years, courts in California have based respondeat superior liability not on a theory of control by the employer but rather on the allocation of risk: a business is responsible for the costs associated with the operations of the business, including the tortious conduct of its employees that is “typical of or broadly incidental to the enterprise \[the employer] has undertaken,” the “more or less inevitable toll of a lawful enterprise.”(*Hinman v. Westinghouse Elec. Co.* (1970\) 2 Cal.3d 956, 960\.) The “risks inherent in or created by the enterprise” are properly born by the employer, particularly when the employee who committed the tort “was on company time and was engaged in the very conduct contemplated by the employer.” (*Ibid.*; see also, e.g., *Carr v. Wm C. Crowell Co.* (1946\) 28 Cal.2d 652, 655\-656 \[referring to the “risks of the enterprise”].)  In determining the scope of employment, the California Supreme Court has adopted and repeatedly relied on a standard set forth by the Court of Appeal in *Rodgers v. Kemper Construction Co.* (1975\) 50 Cal.App.3d 608, 618\-619:  “One way to determine whether a risk is inherent in, or created by, an enterprise is to ask whether the actual occurrence was a generally foreseeable consequence of the activity. However, “foreseeability” in this context must be distinguished from “foreseeability” as a test for negligence.In the latter sense, “foreseeable” means a level of probability which would lead a prudent person to take effective precautions whereas “foreseeability” as a test for respondeat superior merely means that in the context of the particular enterprise an employee’s conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer’s business. … In other words, where the question is one of vicarious liability, the inquiry should be whether the risk was one that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental to the enterprise undertaken by the employer.” (See, e.g., *Lisa M., supra,* 12 Cal.4th at p. 299 \[quoting *Rodgers*]; *Farmers Ins. Group v. County of Santa Clara* (1995\) 11 Cal.4th 992, 1004 \[same]; *Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles* (1991\) 54 Cal.3d 202, 209 \[same]; see also CACI No. 3720 (stating that conduct is within the scope of employment if it is “reasonably related to the kinds of tasks that the \[employee] was employed to perform” or “reasonably foreseeable in light of the employer’s business or the \[employee’s] responsibilities.”)  “To hold an employer vicariously liable the employee must be engaged in the duties which he was employed to perform or those acts which incidentally or indirectly contribute to the employer’s service.Conversely, the employer is not liable when the employee is pursuing his own ends.”(*Tryer v. Ojai Valley School* (1992\) 9 Cal.App.4th 1476, 1481 \[citations and quotation marks omitted].) In the context of respondeat superior liability, courts construe “scope of employment” broadly.(*Farmers Ins. Group, supra,* 11 Cal.4th at p. 1004; *Jorge v. Culinary Institute of America* (2016\) 3 Cal.App.5th 382, 385; *Jeewarat v. Warner Bros. Entertainment* (2009\) 177 Cal.App.4th 427, 434\.)“Where the employee is combining his own business with that of his employer, or attending to both at substantially the same time, no nice inquiry will be made as to which business he was actually engaged in at the time of injury, unless it clearly appears that neither directly or indirectly could he have been serving his employer.”(*Farmers Ins. Group, supra,* 11 Cal.4th at p. 1004; accord *Perez v. Van Groningen \& Sons* (1986\) 41 Cal.3d 962, 970; *Jorge, supra,* 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 386; *Jeewarat, supra,* 177 Cal.App.4th at pp. 434\-435\.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Scott was an agent or employee of Curacao.(SAC, ¶ 21\.)Plaintiff alleges that when Defendant Scott attacked him, Defendant Scott “was acting in the course and within the scope of his authority as agent and employee, and in the transaction of the business of the employment or agency.”(*Ibid.*) Plaintiff has set forth a sufficient pleading of the ultimate facts.Curacao contends that it was not the employer of Defendant Scott and that Defendant Scott was not acting within the scope of his duties, but the Court must accept as true the allegations of the SAC.If they are not true, Curacao will have an adequate opportunity to develop a factual record and present its case at trial (or, potentially, on summary judgment.) The demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is overruled. *Third Cause of Action (Negligent Hiring, Training, Retention, and Supervision)* “California case law recognizes the theory that an employer can be liable to a third person for negligently hiring, supervising, or retaining an unfit employee.”(*Doe v. Capital Cities* (1996\) 50 Cal.App.4th 1038, 1054; accord *Evan F. v. Hughson United Methodist Church* (1992\) 8 Cal.App.4th 828, 836\.)“Negligence liability will be imposed on an employer if it knew or should have known that hiring the employee created a particular risk or hazard and that particular harm materializes.”(*Phillips v. TLC Plumbing, Inc.* (2009\) 172 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1139\.)“Liability … is based upon the reasoning that if an enterprise hires individuals with characteristics which might pose a danger to customers or other employees, the enterprise should bear the loss caused by the wrongdoing of its incompetent or unfit employees.”(*Mendoza v. City of Los Angeles* (1998\) 66 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1339\.) Plaintiff alleges that Curacao was the employer of Defendant Scott and knew or should have known that Scott was incompetent and unfit to perform his duties and posed an undue risk to Plaintiff and others.(SAC, ¶¶ 24\-25\.)Plaintiff further alleges that despite its advance knowledge, Curacao retained Scott as an employee in conscious disregard for the safety o of others.(SAC, ¶ 26\.) Plaintiff has set forth a sufficient pleading of the ultimate facts.If these facts are not true, Curacao will have an adequate opportunity to develop a factual record and present its case at trial (or, potentially, on summary judgment.) The demurrer to the Third Cause of Action is overruled. *Fourth Cause of Action (Abuse of Dependent Adult)* Welfare and Institutions Code section 15657, part of the Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (the “Elder Abuse Act”), provides: “Where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that a defendant is liable for physical abuse as defined in Section 15610\.63, neglect as defined in Section 15610\.57, or abandonment as defined in Section 15610\.05, and that the defendant has been guilty of recklessness, oppression, fraud, or malice in the commission of this abuse, the following shall apply, in addition to all other remedies otherwise provided by law: (a) The court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. The term “costs” includes, but is not limited to, reasonable fees for the services of a conservator, if any, devoted to the litigation of a claim brought under this article. (b) The limitations imposed by Section 377\.34 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the damages recoverable shall not apply. However, the damages recovered shall not exceed the damages permitted to be recovered pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 3333\.2 of the Civil Code. (c) The standards set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 3294 of the Civil Code regarding the imposition of punitive damages on an employer based upon the acts of an employee shall be satisfied before any damages or attorney’s fees permitted under this section may be imposed against an employer.” A dependent adult, within the meaning of the Elder Abuse Act, is a person “who has physical or mental limitations that restrict his or her ability to carry out normal activities or to protect his or her rights” and includes an adult “who is admitted as an inpatient to a 24\-hour health facility.”(Welf. \& Inst. Code, § 15610\.23\.)The Elder Abuse Act defines “physical abuse” to include battery.(Welf. \& Inst. Code, § 15610\.63, subd. (b).) “A battery is any willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another.” (Pen. Code, § 242\.) Plaintiff alleges in the SAC that he was a dependent adult at the time of the incident and that he suffered a battery.(SAC, ¶¶ 28, 30\-31\.) In its demurrer to this cause of action, Curacao makes essentially two arguments. First, Curacao argues that the civil action provisions of the Elder Abuse Act apply only to a defendant that has the care and custody of the elder.(Mem. at pp. 10\-11\.)In support of this Curacao cites *Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc.* (2016\) 63 Cal.4th 148, but *Winn* does not support such a narrow reading of the statute.Section 15657 provides for heightened remedies for physical abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and the California Supreme Court in *Winn* addressed only the meaning of the word neglect in the statute.As to neglect, the court stated:  “\[The Elder Abuse] Act does not apply unless the defendant health care provider had a substantial caretaking or custodial relationship, involving ongoing responsibility for one or more basic needs, with the elder patient.It is the nature of the elder or dependent adult’s relationship with the defendant … that makes the defendant potentially liable for neglect.” (63 Cal. 4th at p. 152\.) In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges physical abuse, not neglect.Accordingly, the limitations set forth in *Winn* as to liability for neglect do not apply here. Second, Curacao argues that the cause of action under the Elder Abuse Act is derivative of the battery claim, and Plaintiff makes no claim of battery against Curacao.(Mem., at p. 11\.)But Plaintiff has alleged that Curacao is vicariously liable for the alleged battery by Defendant Scott, and Curacao makes no argument (and the Court is aware of no case law holding) that the ordinary principles of vicarious liability do not apply to actions under the Elder Abuse Act. The demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action is overruled. *Fifth Cause of Action (Civil Code Section 51\.7\)* Civil Code section 51\.7, known as the Ralph Civil Rights Act, provides in part: “All persons within the jurisdiction of this state have the right to be free from any violence, or intimidation by threat of violence, committed against their persons or property because of political affiliation, or on account of any characteristic listed or defined in subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51, or position in a labor dispute, or because another person perceives them to have one or more of those characteristics.”  (Civ. Code, § 51\.7, subd. (b)(1\).)The characteristics listed or defined in Civil Code Section 51 include (among many others) disability, medical condition, race, and color.(Civ. Code, § 51, subds. (b) \& (e).) The elements of a cause of action under section 51\.7 are: (1\) that the defendant committed or threatened to commit a violent act against the plaintiff; (2\) that a substantial motivating reason for the conduct was plaintiff’s protected characteristic (or the defendant’s perception of plaintiff’s protected characteristic); (3\) that the plaintiff was harmed; and (4\) that the defendant’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff’s harm.(See *Gabrielle A. v. County of Orange* (2017\) 10 Cal.App.5th 1268, 1291; *Austin B. v. Escondido Union School Dist.* (2007\) 149 Cal.App.4th 860, 880\-81; CACI 3063, 3064\.) Plaintiff alleges in the SAC that Defendant Scott committed a violent act against him and, on information and belief, that Defendant Scott “was motivated by his perception of plaintiff’s race and/or color and/or disability and/or medical condition when he assaulted and battered plaintiff.”(SAC, ¶¶ 34\-38\.) In its demurrer to this cause of action, Curacao makes essentially two arguments. First, Curacao argues that under the facts alleged in the SAC, section 51\.7 does not apply, that any act of violence by Defendant Scott was motivated by self\-defense, and if any violation occurred, Plaintiff was the perpetrator.(Mem. at pp. 12\-13\.)But the Court cannot determine, on demurrer, whether Defendant Scott has a valid affirmative defense to this cause of action (whether based on self\-defense or otherwise) or what Defendant Scott’s true motivation was.Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant Scott attacked him and was motivated by his perception of Plaintiff’s protected characteristics, and on demurrer the Court must accept that allegation as true.A plaintiff may plead a defendant’s state of mind in general terms. Second, Curacao argues that the cause of action under section 51\.7 is derivative of the battery claim, and Plaintiff makes no claim of battery against Curacao.(Mem., at p. 13\.)But Plaintiff has alleged that Curacao is vicariously liable for the alleged battery by Defendant Scott, and Curacao makes no argument (and the Court is aware of no case law holding) that the ordinary principles of vicarious liability do not apply to actions under Civil Code section 51\.7\. The demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action is overruled. *Motion to Strike* Curacao moves to strike the following thirteen items from Plaintiff’s SAC: (1\)Plaintiffs Second Cause of Action for Respondent Superior in its entirety as Defendant Curacao did not employ nor control Defendant Scott;  (2\)Plaintiffs Third Cause of Action for Negligent Hiring, Training, Retention, Assignment, and/or Supervision as Defendant Curacao did not employ nor control Defendant Scott, nor were the facts as stated by Plaintiff incidental to or consistent with his job duties as a security guard;  (3\)Plaintiffs Fourth Cause of Action for Abuse of Dependent Adult as the statute upon which the claim is based Welfare \& Institutions Code, Section 15600 et. seq. are inapplicable to tort claims occurring outside of a residential care facility in which the Plaintiff was a patient;  (4\)Plaintiffs Fourth Cause of Action for Abuse of Dependent Adult, based upon Welfare \& Institutions Code, Section 15610\.23 is parasitic to, and dependent upon, the claim of Battery, a Cause of Action that Defendant Curacao is not included as a party Defendant;  (5\)Plaintiffs Fifth Cause of Action for violation of Civil Code, Section 51\. 7 is inapplicable to Defendant Curacao as Plaintiffs own actions in refusing Defendant Scott's instructions to leave the employee parking garage were the cause in fact of the incident, not some perceived pulmonary disability that no one, other than the Plaintiff, could potentially know;  (6\)Plaintiffs Fifth Cause of Action for violation of Civil Code, Section 51\. 7 is parasitic to, and dependent upon, the claim of Battery, a Cause of Action that Defendant Curacao is not included as a party Defendant;  (7\)Paragraphs 8, 21, 22, 24, and 29 pertaining to the Plaintiff falsely claiming that Defendant Scott as an employee of Defendant Curacao and two other Defendants;  (8\)Paragraphs 25, 26 \& 27 pertaining to Defendant Curacao having advanced knowledge of potential harm caused by Defendant All American Protective Services Inc., hiring Defendant Scott; (9\)Paragraph 33 pertaining to Defendant Curacao "ratification" of Defendant Scott's actions;  (10\)Paragraph 38 pertaining to Defendant Scott being able to perceive the pulmonary disability of the Plaintiff;  (11\)Paragraphs 19, 27, 32, and Plaintiffs Prayer for Punitive Damages, page 9, number 3, regarding Plaintiffs allegations pertaining to punitive damages;  (12\)Paragraphs 32, 40 and Plaintiffs Prayer for Costs and Attorney's fees pursuant to Welfare \& Institutions Code, Section 15657, page 9, Prayer Item No. 5; and  (13\)Paragraph 40 and Plaintiffs Prayer for a civil penalty and attorney fees pursuant to Civil Code, Section 52, page 9\-10, Prayer Item Nos. 6 and 7, regarding Plaintiffs allegations of a civil penalty of $25,000\. For the same reasons set forth above in connection with the discussion of the demurrer, the motion to strike is denied as to Items 1 through 6\. On a motion to strike, the Court must accept the allegations of the complaint as true.For this reason, the motion to strike is denied as to Items 7 through 10\. The Court now turns to the issue of punitive damages, a civil penalty, attorney’s fees, and costs. *Punitive Damages* To recover punitive damages in a tort action, Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (a), requires that a plaintiff prove by clear and convincing evidence “that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.” In subdivision (c), the Legislature defines the terms “oppression,” “fraud,” and “malice” for purposes of recovering punitive damages under section 3294:  (1\) “Malice” means conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.  (2\) “Oppression” means despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person's rights.  (3\) “Fraud” means an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1\)\-(3\).)  The law is clear that to recover punitive damages in a tort action, Civil Code section 3294 requires a plaintiff to prove by clear and convincing evidence “that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.”(Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a); see also (*College Hosp., Inc. v. Super. Ct.* (1994\) 8 Cal.4th 704, 721; *Smith v. Super. Ct.* (1992\) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042\.)  “Malice” is defined in section 3294, subdivision (c)(1\), as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”  “Oppression” is defined in section 3294, subdivision (c)(2\), as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” “Fraud” is defined in section 3294, subdivision (c)(3\), as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” The term “despicable conduct,” as used in subdivisions (c)(1\) and (c)(2\), has been defined in thecase law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (See, e.g., *College Hospital, supra,* 8 Cal.4th at p. 725; *Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales \& Marketing, Inc.* (2000\) 78 Cal. App. 4th 847, 891; see also CACI 3940 \[“Despicable conduct is conduct that is so vile, base, or contemptible that it would be looked down on and despised by reasonable people.”].) The basis for punitive damages must be pleaded with particularity; conclusory allegations devoid of any factual assertions are insufficient. (*Ibid.*; see also *Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. v. Snepp* (2009\) 171 Cal.App.4th 598, 643\.) A motion to strike may also lie where the facts alleged, if proven, would not support a finding that the defendant acted with malice, fraud, or oppression. (*Today IV’s Inc. v. Los Angeles County MTA* (2022\) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193; *Turman, supra,* 191 Cal. App. 4th at p. 63\.) Pleading negligence, gross negligence, or even recklessness is not sufficient. (*Dawes v. Super. Ct.* (1980\) 111 Cal. App. 3d 82, 87\.) Rather, a plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating that the defendant intended to cause harm to plaintiff or “acted in such an outrageous and reprehensible manner that the jury could infer that \[the defendant] knowingly disregarded the substantial certainty of injury to others.” (*Id.* at p. 90; see also, e.g., *American Airlines, Inc. v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter \& Hampton* (2002\) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017\.). As against Curacao, Plaintiff seeks to recover punitive damages under a theory of vicarious liability theory (that is, Plaintiffs seek punitive damages against Curacao as employer or principal for the conduct of its employee or agent).Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages is governed by Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b).That subdivision provides:  “An employer shall not be liable for damages pursuant to subdivision (a) \[i.e., punitive damages], based upon acts of an employee of the employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.” The Court has reviewed the SAC and considered the arguments presented by each side.The Court concludes that Plaintiff has not pleaded, with particularity, a basis to recover punitive damages.Plaintiff’s general pleading is not sufficient. The motion to strike the punitive damages allegations, as against Curacao, is granted. Because the basis of the ruling is a failure to allege a basis to recover punitive damages with sufficient particularity, the motion is granted with leave to amend. *Civil Penalty* In his Fifth Cause of Action, Plaintiff seeks to recover a civil penalty under Civil Code section 52, subdivision (b)(2\).Curacao moves to strike the references to a civil penalty, but it provides no substantial argument in support of this request in its memorandum. The motion to strike the civil penalty allegation, as against Curacao, is denied.  *Attorney’s Fees* In his Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action, Plaintiff seeks to recover attorney’s fees under Welfare and Institutions Code section 15657, subdivision (a), and Civil Code section 52, subdivision (b)(3\).Curacao moves to strike the references to attorney’s fees, but it provides no substantial argument in support of this request in its memorandum. The motion to strike the attorney’s fees allegations, as against Curacao, are denied. *Costs* In his Fourth Causes of Action, Plaintiff seeks to recover costs under Welfare and Institutions Code section 15657, subdivision (a).Curacao moves to strike the references to costs, but it provides no substantial argument in support of this request in its memorandum. The motion to strike the costs allegations, as against Curacao, are denied. **Conclusion** The Court OVERRULES Curacao’s demurrer. The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Curacao’s motion to strike. The Court STRIKES the words “Curacao, Ltd.” on page 6, line 26 of the SAC. The Court STRIKES the words “Curacao, Ltd.” on page 8, lines 4 and 9 of the SAC. The Court STRIKES the prayer for punitive damages (page 9, line 21\) as against Defendant Curacao only. The Court GRANTS LEAVE to Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 10 days of notice. Moving Party is to give notice.  ---   **Case Number:**  23STCV25592    **Hearing Date:**  February 10, 2025    **Dept:**  29 McElroy v. Villasenor 23STCV25592 Defendant’s Motion to Vacate the Trial Date or, in the alternative, to Continue Trial  **Tentative** The motion is denied in part and granted in part. **Background** On October 19, 2023, Nicole McElroy (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Anthony Villasenor (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an alleged accident on July 5, 2022\.When the case was filed, the Court assigned a trial date of April 17, 2025\.   Defendant was served in October 2024\.On November 12, 2024, Defendant filed an answer.   On January 2, 2025, Defendant filed this motion to vacate trial and final status conference date based on Plaintiff’s failure to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3\.110 or, in the alternative, to continue trial. No opposition has been filed.  **Legal Standard** California Rules of Court, rule 3\.110 states a “complaint must be served on all named defendants and proofs of service on those defendants must be filed with the court within 60 days after the filing of the complaint. When the complaint is amended to add a defendant, the added defendant must be served and proof of service must be filed within 30 days after the filing of the amended complaint.” Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(8\), provides that the court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (*Color\-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams* (1996\) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603\.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (*Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens* (1975\) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18\.) “To ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm.All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as certain.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(a).) “Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(c).)“The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.”(*Ibid.*) Circumstances that may support a finding of good cause include: “(1\) The unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (2\) The unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (3\) The unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances; (4\) The substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in the interests of justice; (5\) The addition of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's involvement in the case; (6\) A party's excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts; or (7\) A significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(c).) “In ruling on a motion or application for continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are relevant to the determination.”(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(d).)California Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(d) sets forth a non\-exhaustive list of factors that the court may consider: “(1\) The proximity of the trial date; (2\) Whether there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party; (3\) The length of the continuance requested; (4\) The availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a continuance; (5\) The prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;  (6\) If the case is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay;  (7\) The court's calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials;  (8\) Whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial; (9\) Whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; (10\) Whether the interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and (11\) Any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3\.1332(d).)  **Discussion** Defendant seeks to vacate or continue the April 17, 2025 trial date. Defendant was served in October 2024, about a year after the complaint was filed.With a trial date of April 2025, Defendant states that he does not have time to complete discovery and prepare for trial. Given the delay in service, Defendant has shown good cause for a trial continuance.The Court, in its discretion, declines to vacate the trial date and set a Trial Setting Conference, as a trial continuance is sufficient to protect Defendant from any unfair prejudice. The Court finds good cause to continue trial to early October 2025\.On this record, the Court finds that this should give Defendant more than sufficient time to complete discovery and prepare for trial.If, however, there are unexpected delays, Defendant may seek a further continuance in the future (either by motion or stipulation) based on a further showing of good cause. **Conclusion** The Court DENIES IN PART and GRANTS IN PART Defendant’s motion to vacate the trial and final status conference dates, or in the alternative, to continue trial. The Court DENIES Defendant’s request to vacate the trial date.  The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request to continue trial.  Trial is continued to October \_\_, 2025\.The Final Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date. Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.  --- |
