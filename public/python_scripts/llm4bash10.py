Crucially, the specific models and their capabilities you have access to can depend on factors like your geographic region, your account type (e.g., whether you\'re using a free tier or have a paid subscription with access to Vertex AI), and ongoing updates from Google.\n\nHere\'s a breakdown of what\'s typically available and the key distinctions:\n\n1.  **Gemini 1.0 Pro:** This is the most generally available and versatile model in Google AI Studio.  It\'s designed for a wide range of text-based tasks. Key capabilities include:\n\n    *   **Text Generation:**  Creating different creative text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.  It can follow your instructions and try to fulfill your requests.\n    *   **Question Answering:** Answering questions in an informative way, even if they are open-ended, challenging, or strange.  It uses its knowledge base and reasoning abilities.\n    *   **Summarization:**  Condensing large amounts of text into concise summaries.\n    *   **Translation:**  Translating between many languages (though quality can vary).\n    *   **Chatbot-style Conversation:**  Engaging in dialogue, maintaining context over multiple turns (although its memory is still limited compared to specialized chatbot platforms).\n    *   **Code Generation and Explanation:** Assisting with coding tasks. It can generate code snippets in various programming languages, explain existing code, and help debug.  It\'s important to review and test any generated code carefully.\n\n2.  **Gemini 1.0 Ultra (Limited Access):**  Ultra is the largest and most capable model. As of this response, access is typically restricted and often requires a waiting list or specific program enrollment.  If you have access, you\'ll usually find it through Vertex AI integration, rather than directly within the basic Google AI Studio interface.  It excels at:\n\n    *   **Highly Complex Tasks:**  Tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning, nuanced understanding, and creative problem-solving.\n    *   **Multimodal Capabilities (Key Feature):**  Ultra is designed to handle multiple modalities, meaning it can process and understand not just text, but also images, audio, and video.  This is a *major* difference from Pro.  You could, for instance, give it an image and ask it to describe the scene, or provide code and an image and ask it to generate documentation relating the two.  The extent of these multimodal features may still be evolving.\n    *   **Improved Performance:** Generally better performance across all tasks compared to Pro.\n\n3.  **Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision:** This is a very important variant of Gemini Pro.  It is *specifically* designed to handle both text and image input (a subset of the full multimodal capabilities of Ultra). This is directly available in Google AI Studio.  Examples:\n\n    *   **Image Description:** You can provide an image and ask for a detailed description.\n    *   **Visual Question Answering:**  Ask questions about the content of an image (e.g., "What color is the car in this picture?").\n    *   **Combined Text and Image Prompts:**  You can give a text instruction that refers to an image (e.g., "Write a caption for this image").\n\n4. **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Preview):** This model is newer, and in preview. It often has limited access. Key improvements:\n    * **Longer Context Window**: This model can take into account much larger portions of text, making it much better at summarizing, analyzing, and working with massive documents.\n    * **Better Overall Performance**\n\n**How to Check Which Models are Available to *You***\n\n1.  **Go to Google AI Studio:**  Open the Google AI Studio interface (makersuite.google.com).\n2.  **Create a New Prompt:** Start a new prompt (either a freeform prompt, structured prompt, or chat prompt).\n3.  **Look at the Model Selection:**  In the right-hand panel, under "Run settings," you\'ll see a dropdown menu for "Model." This will list the specific models available to your account.  You\'ll likely see "Gemini 1.0 Pro" and "Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision."\n4. **Check the Vertex AI Integration:** If you have access to Google Cloud\'s Vertex AI, and you\'ve linked it to your Google AI Studio account, you *might* see additional models listed (like Gemini 1.0 Ultra, or specialized fine-tuned models). This connection often gives access to more powerful and customizable options.\n\n**Key Considerations & How to Choose:**\n\n*   **Task Complexity:** For basic text tasks, Gemini 1.0 Pro is usually sufficient. For complex reasoning or tasks involving images and text, consider Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision or, if you have access, Gemini 1.5 Pro or Gemini 1.0 Ultra.\n*   **Multimodality:** If you *need* to work with images, Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision is the readily available choice in AI Studio. Gemini 1.0 Ultra is the ideal choice for broader multimodal needs (audio, video), but access is limited.\n*   **Cost (Vertex AI):** If you\'re using models through Vertex AI, be aware of the pricing structure. Google AI Studio\'s basic interface with Gemini 1.0 Pro and Vision is often free within usage limits.\n*   **Context Length:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is best for tasks with lots of text.\n*   **Experimentation:** The best way to find the right model is to try different ones with your specific prompts and see which gives you the best results.\n\nIn summary, Google AI Studio gives you direct, easy access to the Gemini family, with Gemini 1.0 Pro and Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision being the most readily available.  Access to more advanced models (Ultra, 1.5 Pro) often requires a Vertex AI connection or specific program participation.

Looking at the structure of the `response` object you shared, I can see it's a `GenerateContentResponse` object from Google's Gemini API. Let me help you extract the text fields with some Python expressions.

The main text content appears to be nested within the object structure. Here's how you can access it:

```python
# Most direct way to access the text content
text_content = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text

# If you want to print it
print(text_content)
```

The structure follows this pattern:
1. `response` (GenerateContentResponse object)
2. `.candidates` (list containing Candidate objects)
3. First element `[0]` of that list
4. `.content` property of the Candidate
5. `.parts` (list of Part objects)
6. First element `[0]` of parts
7. `.text` property containing the actual text

You can also access other fields like:

```python
# Access model version
model_version = response.model_version
print(f"Model version: {model_version}")  # Should give you 'gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05'

# Access token counts
total_tokens = response.usage_metadata.total_token_count
prompt_tokens = response.usage_metadata.prompt_token_count
candidates_tokens = response.usage_metadata.candidates_token_count

print(f"Total tokens: {total_tokens}")
print(f"Prompt tokens: {prompt_tokens}")
print(f"Response tokens: {candidates_tokens}")
```

If you need to check if certain fields exist before accessing them (to avoid errors), you can use:

```python
# Safely access nested properties
def get_nested_attr(obj, path, default=None):
    """Access nested attributes safely with a path like 'a.b.c[0].d'"""
    try:
        for part in path.replace(']', '').replace('[', '.').split('.'):
            if part.isdigit():
                obj = obj[int(part)]
            else:
                obj = getattr(obj, part)
        return obj
    except (AttributeError, IndexError, TypeError):
        return default

# Example usage
text = get_nested_attr(response, 'candidates[0].content.parts[0].text', '')
```

Do any of these approaches work for what you're trying to do? I can provide more specific examples if you have a particular field you're interested in extracting.

Yes, this works well:
response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text

It turns out that the info in the response from google is not very useful.

So, Please answer this question:

Please describe the current LLM models available Mar 1 2025, to me in Google AIStudio.Thanks!
