Hi,
Your job is to mimic a Law Clerk
who will summarize the legal information in
the attached file.
This file contains a text representation
of a legal document
which your boss,
a California Court judge to wants to read.
The attached file
also contains some OCR information about how it was created.
This creation information (related to OCR and LLM actions) is not very interesting to the judge.
The judge wants to know all the names of listed in legal_info_and_ocr_info.txt
The judge wants to sort relevant events by date.
Other items the judge wants to know:
- Roles connected to each name.
- Facts, Disputes, any mentions of money or property.
- Legal "Elements" of any claims or Causes of Action.
- Facts under dispute.
- Legal conclusions under dispute.
- Other relevant cases affecting Plaintiff or Defendant.
- Other relevant cases from Case Law.
- Any statutes applicable to this case.
And the judge wants to know
any information
which you, an alert and knowledgeable Law Clerk,
deems relevant to the judge's goals.
As a Law Clerk,
please read and understand your summarizing-job as it is descrbed above.
Please summarize the legal information in
the attached file
for the judge so the judge can write wise, knowledgeable, and fair rulings.
Thanks!
