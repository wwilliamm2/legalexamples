Hi,
Please study the text in the attached document and use your semantic knowledge
to fix typos made by OCR software. For example hel1o should be changed to
hello and $1o,42m3.OQ should be $10,4233.00.
Sacramento Coimty should be Sacramento County.
If you encounter a word which fails spell-check but visually resembles a valid
word, please consider that you have just encountered an OCR-typo.
More examples of OCR typos:
Tmstee should be Trustee, Febmary should be February, tme should be true, or time or tame or me.
After you correct the typos in that text,
Please extract the corrected text, verbatim, from your context,
and show it to me.
I want to copy and paste that corrected text into my editor.
Thanks!

Please format the text in your response
so it matches the old-style of legal documents
which were written by typewriters.
Thanks!
